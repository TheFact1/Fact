      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO10:0510:05Ether pops 13%, Yuga Labs' new metaverse, and why miners are selling crypto: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto WorldNew data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows that miners are rapidly exiting their bitcoin positions.14,000 bitcoin, worth more than $300 million at its current price, was transferred out of wallets belonging to miners in a single 24-hour period at the end of last week — and in the last few weeks, miners have offloaded the largest amount of bitcoin since Jan. 2021. The phenomenon is called \"miner capitulation,\" and it typically indicates that miners are preparing to sell their previously mined coins in order to cover ongoing mining expenses.Bitcoin is currently trading around $21,600, up about 3% in the last 24 hours. Still, the wider crypto market has been in a slump for months, with bitcoin down nearly 70% from its all-time high of around $69,000 in Nov. 2021.Meanwhile, inflation is on a tear, and the cost of energy is hitting record highs as the war between Russia and Ukraine rages on.Lower bitcoin prices and higher energy costs are compressing profit margins for miners, which is part of why some are selling bitcoin at current prices to try to contain exposure to continued volatility in the sector and mitigate against further risk to their bottom line.\"Given rising electricity costs, and bitcoin's steep price decline, the cost of mining a bitcoin may be higher than its price for some miners,\" Citi analyst Joseph Ayoub wrote in a note on July 5.\"With high-profile reports of resignations from mining companies, as well as miners that have used their equipment as collateral to borrow money, the bitcoin mining industry could be under growing pressure,\" the note continued.'Our costs, expenses, and liabilities are in dollars'Core Scientific, which is one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies in the U.S., sold nearly all its bitcoin in June. CEO Mike Levitt tells CNBC that just like any other business, bitcoin miners need to pay their bills.\"We mine and earn or produce bitcoin, but our costs, expenses, and liabilities are in dollars,\" said Levitt.It's still profitable to mine bitcoin, Levitt says, with around 50% margins across the industry. That's down from 80% margins at its peak.Last month, Core sold 7,202 bitcoin at an average price of $23,000. Levitt tells CNBC they invested the proceeds of approximately $167 million primarily into growth-oriented activities, including new ASIC servers and additional data center capacity for their self-mining and colocation businesses.But they also deployed some of that capital to repay debt and to help settle five years of employee stock grants.Long-term, Levitt is optimistic because there's tremendous positive operating leverage in the business. Over certain levels, every dollar increase in the price of bitcoin is 100% operating income to bitcoin miners.\"We would all be cheering loudly if bitcoin were to get back to $35,000, $40,000. There is no doubt about that,\" he said.But productivity per unit of electricity also matters, and when prices are low, large-scale miners like Core Scientific tend to face less competition from hobbyists and small operations.\"As prices fall, the global hashrate — or the competition for the production of bitcoin — decreases, as less efficient miners come off the network,\" explained Levitt.The hashrate is a term used to describe the computing power of all miners in the bitcoin network, and it is down 15% in the last month. That is ultimately a good thing for the large-scale miners who can afford to weather the downturns.As less efficient miners come off the network and global hashrate declines, machines that continue to mine bitcoin get more productive.\"And thus, the cost of energy, if you will, per bitcoin produced, goes down,\" said Levitt.watch nowVIDEO3:1003:10Can platforms with weak business models survive crypto contagion?Power Lunch] \n",

Staking products allow investors to use crypto holdings to earn yield, or other rewards.\"We see lots of the large banks, customers wanting to have tokenized securities being able to trade traditional assets 24/7,\" Tom Pageler, chief executive officer at Prime Trust told \"Crypto World\" Wednesday. \"This funding will ensure we can bring that value add to all of our customers.\"Payment processing firm FIS is among the investors in the round along with Fin Capital, Mercato Partners, Kraken Ventures, Commerce Ventures, William Blair & Co. and others.Prime Trust serves about 700 customers, ranging from crypto exchanges, on ramps, wallet apps, ATSs, RIAs, broker dealers and banks. Pageler said investors weren't too spooked by the bearishness in the market this year and saw the timing of the investment as a good opportunity.\"We're seeing crypto and the traditional markets going up and down together, which is great,\" Pageler said. \"It means that crypto, digital assets have become a well-established market; they're trending with the global economy in general.\"] \n",

Coinbase has roughly 5,000 full-time workers, translating to a head count reduction of around 1,100 people.Shares of Coinbase closed down .83%.CEO Brian Armstrong pointed to a possible recession, and a need to manage Coinbase's burn rate and increase efficiency. He also said the company grew \"too quickly\" during a bull market.\"We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,\" Armstrong said in the email, adding that past crypto winters have resulted in a significant decline in trading activity. \"While it's hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment.\"Coinbase Founder and CEO Brian Armstrong attends Consensus 2019 at the Hilton Midtown on May 15, 2019 in New York City.Steven Ferdman | Getty ImagesCoinbase had initially said it was pausing hiring. Two weeks later, the crypto giant announced that it was extending the freeze for the \"foreseeable future.\" Earlier this year, Coinbase said it planned to add 2,000 jobs across product, engineering and design.\"Our employee costs are too high to effectively manage this uncertain market,\" Armstrong said. \"While we tried our best to get this just right, in this case it is now clear to me that we over-hired.\"The news comes during a deep rout for Coinbase shares. The stock went public via a direct listing last April during a boom in crypto markets and investors clamoring for high-growth tech stocks. Coinbase's shares are down 79% this year and 85% from the all-time high. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped to near $22,000 and has lost 53% of its value this year.watch nowVIDEO13:2313:23Coinbase cuts 18% of workforce and bitcoin briefly falls to $20,000: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto WorldSan Francisco-based Coinbase reported a slump in users in its last quarter and a 27% decline in revenue from a year ago. The company gets the majority of its top line from transaction fees, which are closely tied to trading activity.President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi called it a \"very difficult decision for Coinbase\" but given the economic backdrop, she said it \"felt like the most prudent thing to do right now.\"Affected employees received a notification from human resources. If so, the memo was sent to a personal email as Coinbase cut off access to the company systems. Armstrong called it the \"only practical choice\" given the number of employees with access to customer information, and a way to \"ensure not even a single person made a rash decision that harmed the business or themselves.\"Employees of Coinbase Global Inc, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, watch as their listing is displayed on the Nasdaq MarketSite jumbotron at Times Square in New York, U.S., April 14, 2021.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersCoinbase employees will have access to a talent hub to find new jobs in the industry, including Coinbase Ventures' portfolio companies. Choi said Coinbase would still be \"doubling down\" on areas like security and compliance and may be \"reorienting\" employees to near-term revenue drivers.\"If there are any cuts to new product areas, it's going to be more around experimental venture areas that we're still very bullish on, but that we don't want to invest in in this part of the cycle,\" Choi told CNBC in an interview at the company's headquarters.\"We will continue to invest in incredible innovative areas of crypto that we think are emerging over the longer term, but we're probably going to do those in a more measured way in this type of an environment.\"Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it. This time the Fed's steering the shipApple may be seeing a demand split for iPhone 14 models, Bank of America saysMorgan Stanley says this EV battery maker can rally as much as 350%Coinbase joins dozens of other tech and crypto companies slamming the brakes on hiring. Crypto lender BlockFi said Monday it was cutting 20% of its employees. Open-source tracker Layoffs.fyi estimates that more than 5,500 start-up and tech jobs have been cut in June alone.Coinbase's intention is \"that this is a one-time event,\" Choi said adding that the company has $6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company has lived through multiple bear markets in crypto before, also known as \"crypto winters.\"\"We will power through any macro environment, any crypto winter, or anything that's coming,\" she said. \"The reality though, is that we have to adjust when we feel that there's a very dynamic economic environment in play.\"Tech companies have been fighting low morale and attrition as their stocks get slammed. Last week, a petition posted to a decentralized publishing platform called for the removal and a \"vote of no confidence\" regarding several Coinbase executives, including Choi.Armstrong called attention to the since-deleted petition, and in a Tweet urged employees to quit if they don't believe in the company.\"We will always encourage our employees to share feedback internally on how we operate as a company — and we have a number of mechanisms in place for them to do so. It's very much unclear if this document came from within the company,\" Choi said. \"However, if it did, we're disappointed that those behind it felt the need to breach the trust of the company and their co-workers by sharing this information in a way clearly designed to drive controversy rather than a meaningful dialogue.\" Coinbase has no plans to offer additional company equity grants, or cash compensation amid the price drop, Choi said. The company offers annual grants, partially so employees could \"mitigate the swings\" and volatility in crypto. For employees and investors, the COO likened it to Amazon or Tesla: a long-term investment with volatility in the meantime.\"We think that anyone who makes an investment, whether they're an employee or investor, will have a handsome return over the longer term,\" Choi said. \"Coinbase is a long-term play  — we have very deep conviction in the long-term value of the stock.\"] \n",

Each token includes a \"smart contract\" with metadata that Vaynerchuk can use to interact with its buyer. Token holders also are given exclusive access to the annual event for three years after the NFT's purchase.\"VeeFriends\" character mascots getting ready for Gary Vaynerchuk's \"VeeCon\" conference.Riley de León | CNBCNot only is this the inaugural VeeCon, it's also the first-ever NFT-ticketed event. Token holders access their ticket via a digital wallet on their phones that verifies their ownership of Vaynerchuk's digital assets.NFTs are a type of digital asset created to track ownership of a virtual item using blockchain technology. Such unique items could be artwork or sports trading cards — a market that Vaynerchuk became familiar with as a teenager, peddling baseball cards for thousands of dollars every week.The price of ethereum has recently traded down by as much as 60% from its 2021 peak.\"The timing of VeeCon could not be better,\" Vaynerchuk said in his opening remarks at the conference on Friday. \"There's an incredible chapter of Web3 coming this next year. Everyone here is wildly aware that there has been a correction in [crypto] pricing ... it's not fun when your assets go down on paper. It is what it is, but the timing is remarkable because now a lot of good work gets done. A lot of the innovation gets done.\"The event, hosted at U.S. Bank Stadium, features keynote speakers that have recently come onto the Web3 scene, including Snoop Dogg, Spike Lee, Deepak Chopra, Eva Longoria and Mila Kunis, among others.watch nowVIDEO10:0410:04Bitcoin prices sink, Gary Vee on state of NFT market, Coinbase slashes spending: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World\"Obviously because of who they are, celebrities are going to get a lot of attention and I think they have a responsibility [to educate] with the size of their audience,\" Vaynerchuk told CNBC. \"Anybody involved in this space has to give a lot of thought to whether or not the short term money is worth the reputational risk.\"VeeCon has also been a boon for the local economy in Minneapolis, which is one of many communities around the country attempting to recover lost tourism dollars from the Covid-19 pandemic. In attendance are token holders from around the world, including India, Australia, Romania, France and Sweden.\"As a local Minnesotan, I'm really proud that the first-ever VeeCon is taking place in my backyard,\" said Maha Abouelenein, a local organizer of the event and CEO of media organization Digital & Savvy. \"I can't wait to see all the friendships that are created at VeeCon.\"Still, there's some fear surrounding the space's longevity. Bitcoin hit its lowest level since December 2020 earlier this week, under $26,000, and shares of publicly traded crypto brokerage company Coinbase were down by as much as 74% year-to-date this week.\"Right now the overwhelming energy of the space is very short term. I would call it greed. Many are not spending their time on education,\" Vaynerchuk said.\"The reality is that all that behavior is going to lead to 97-98% of these current projects losing value over the next 24-36 months because the supply and demand curves will not work out.\"] \n",

It is unclear whether this recent rout marks the next crypto winter (a multiyear bear market that occurs on a cyclical basis for the crypto asset class), though dropping trading volumes on crypto exchanges is one sign that we may be headed in that direction.watch nowVIDEO2:3402:34'Crypto winter is here,' says Winklevoss twinsFast MoneyThe last so-called crypto winter ran from 2018 into the fall of 2020 as the value of cryptocurrencies plunged and layoffs were rife.Gemini — which has been around since 2014 and is valued at $7.1 billion as of its last funding round — has 1,033 people on its payroll, according to PitchBook, which translates to about 100 employees affected by today's layoffs. CNBC reached out to Gemini to ask for the exact figure, but the press team declined to comment beyond the blog post.As for next steps, Gemini has closed its physical offices today in order to protect employee privacy. Impacted team members will receive a calendar invite for individual conversations about separation packages and health care benefits. On Friday, remaining employees will take part in a \"company-wide standup\" to talk about its future.The memo says that Gemini wants to focus only on products that are critical to its mission — and team leaders will assess whether their teams are \"right-sized\" for the \"current, turbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time.\"\"Today is a tough day, but one that will make Gemini better over the long run,\" the brothers wrote in the staffwide memo.Other fintech start-ups such as Robinhood and BitMEX have recently cut staff.But even as crypto companies pare back their rosters, venture capitalists continue to pour money into the crypto ecosystem. Andreessen Horowitz recently announced a new $4.5 billion fund dedicated to backing crypto and blockchain companies, and Binance Labs (the company's venture arm) has raised $500 million for a fund dedicated to investing in Web3 start-ups.watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [INA FASSBENDER | AFP | Getty ImagesEthereum just completed its first big dress rehearsal for a long-awaited makeover that will be its most significant overhaul since the digital currency was launched nearly a decade ago.Cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin are often criticized for the process of mining to generate new coins. Both currently use a so-called proof-of-work mining model, involving complex math equations that massive numbers of machines race to solve.Ethereum has been working to shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work method for securing the network to a proof-of-stake model, which requires users to leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. This requires far less power than mining and will translate to faster transactions.watch nowVIDEO11:3711:37Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king?CryptoThe transition has been repeatedly pushed back for the last several years because of major flaws in the implementations.Developers told CNBC that the latest test run on Wednesday was very smooth, an important marker as the blockchain for the second-largest cryptocurrency gears up for its landmark move.Here's what happened. Ethereum's longest-lived test network (testnet, for short) simulated a process identical to what the main network (or mainnet) will execute this fall. Testnets allow developers to try out new things before they're rolled out on the main blockchain, giving them time to make necessary tweaks.Wednesday's exercise showed that the proof-of-stake validation process substantially reduces the energy necessary for verifying a block of transactions, and also proved that the merger process works.\"There was no crazy bug that happened,\" said Auston Bunsen, co-founder of QuikNode, which provides blockchain infrastructure to developers and companies. \"Everything went as smooth as it could be.\"Tim Beiko, the coordinator for ethereum's protocol developers, agreed and added that the network is now stable. However, he noted that the test hit \"some minor known issues,\" and developers \"will be spending the next few days triaging them before discussing next steps on this Friday's AllCoreDevs call.\" The price of ether, the token native to the ethereum blockchain, has lost about half its value this year and is trading at just over $1,800.watch nowVIDEO8:2908:29Binance U.S. adds high-yield staking and New York releases stablecoin guidelines: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto WorldWorking out the bugsSince December 2020, the ethereum community has been testing out the proof-of-stake workflow on a chain called beacon. The beacon chain runs alongside the existing proof-of-work chain and already has human validators crunching new blocks.Beacon solves the problems that have arisen from prior efforts to make the switch, according to Beiko.\"We knew that there would be a lot of technical work to address things like the increased centralization that we see in other proof-of-stake systems,\" Beiko told CNBC. \"We've achieved that with the beacon chain.\"Beiko tells CNBC the original proposal required validators to have 1,500 ether, a stake now worth around $2.7 million, in order to use the system. To lower the barrier to entry, the new proof-of-stake proposal would require interested users to have only 32 ether, or about $57,600.Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it. This time the Fed's steering the shipApple may be seeing a demand split for iPhone 14 models, Bank of America saysMorgan Stanley says this EV battery maker can rally as much as 350%\"It's still not a trivial sum, but it's a much more accessible system,\" said Beiko.Developers have been simulating the merge with testnets to pressure test the workflow and the code. On Wednesday, ethereum's longest-running testnet, known as Ropsten (which closely mirrors the mainnet) successfully merged its proof-of-work execution layer with the proof-of-stake beacon chain. It was the first dry run of the process that the mainnet will undergo later this fall, should all go according to plan.Beiko said that testing the merge allowed developers to ensure that the software running the ethereum protocol was stable and \"that everything built on top of the network was ready for the transition.\"Bunsen said that prior to Wednesday, the beacon chain wasn't actually doing much.\"It was just chugging along, creating, for lack of a better term, empty blocks,\" he said.He called Wednesday's trial \"an instantaneous smooth rollout\" and said, \"I can see it happening in the same way for mainnet.\"watch nowVIDEO8:0808:08Can crypto clean up its dirty image?CryptoMore dry runs are expected to happen on testnets called Goerli and Sepolia, giving developers additional opportunities to see what might go wrong before the official show.\"At each testnet, we expect the code to be closer to what will be used on the ethereum mainnet,\" said Beiko. \"We're looking for less friction every time. Hopefully the minor issues we've seen today are resolved by the time we upgrade the next testnet.\"Still, Beiko encourages enthusiasts to exercise caution.\"Users should be aware that ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake requires no action on their part unless they are a validator on the network,\" he said. \"The transition also won't create any 'new' ethereum tokens.\"Beiko encouraged users to watch out for scams and refer to ethereum's blog for announcements.WATCH: UST's crash has some investors reevaluating their crypto investmentswatch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

The two most widely traded cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and ether, are down more than 70% from their peaks last November, and the May collapse of the UST stablecoin sent shockwaves through an already tumultuous market.The news comes a few days after one of Voyager's customers failed to make payments on a loan worth hundreds of millions of dollars, fueling growing concerns of an insolvency contagion effect across the industry.On Monday, the broker issued a notice that prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) had defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. At the time, Voyager said that it intended to pursue recovery from 3AC, and in the interim, said it would continue to operate and fulfill customer orders and withdrawals.As of June 24, Voyager said it had approximately $137 million in U.S. dollars and owned crypto assets. The company also noted that it has access to a $200 million credit line in cash and USDC stablecoins, as well as a 15,000 bitcoin ($318 million) revolving credit line from Alameda Ventures, which is FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's quantitative trading firm.Last week, Alameda committed $500 million in financing to Voyager, and the firm has already pulled $75 million from that line of credit, but it appears that wasn't enough to keep business running as usual.Thus far, investors in the world's two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap seem unfazed by the news. Bitcoin is up about 2% and ethereum is up more than 4% toward the end of regular market hours on Wall Street.Voyager is a competitor to crypto lending firm BlockFi, which has also been caught in the crosshairs of the sector's recent liquidity crunch. FTX has just struck a $680 million credit deal to acquire BlockFi, according to The Block.Voyager's decision tracks that of popular crypto staking and lending platform, Celsius, which similarly paused all withdrawals, swaps, and transfers between accounts due to \"extreme market conditions\" on June 13. Celsius has yet to announce tangible guidance on next steps.watch nowVIDEO9:0309:03Bitcoin rises, and Alchemy reveals exclusive data on surging crypto development: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [A flag outside the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. 23, 2022.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday filed a civil complaint charging 11 people for their roles in creating and promoting an allegedly fraudulent crypto-focused pyramid scheme that raised more than $300 million from investors.The scheme, called Forsage, claimed to be a decentralized smart contract platform, and it allowed millions of retail investors to enter into transactions via smart contracts that operated on the ethereum, tron and binance blockchains. But under the hood, the SEC alleges that for more than two years, the setup functioned like a standard pyramid scheme, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the operation. In the SEC's formal complaint, Wall Street's top watchdog calls Forsage a \"textbook pyramid and Ponzi scheme,\" in which Forsage aggressively promoted its smart contracts through online promotions and new investment platforms, while all the while not selling \"any actual, consumable product.\" The complaint goes on to say that \"the primary way for investors to make money from Forsage was to recruit others into the scheme.\"In a statement, the SEC added that Forsage operated a typical Ponzi structure, wherein it allegedly used assets from new investors to pay earlier ones.\"As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors,\" wrote Carolyn Welshhans, acting chief of the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.\"Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains.\"Forsage, through its support platform, declined to offer a method for contacting the company and did not offer comment.Four of the eleven individuals charged by the SEC are founders of Forsage. Their current whereabouts are unknown, but they were last known to be living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia and Indonesia.The SEC has also charged three U.S.-based promoters who endorsed Forsage on their social media platforms. They were not named in the commission's release.Forsage was launched in January 2020, and regulators around the world had tried a couple of different times to shut it down since then. Cease-and-desist actions were brought against Forsage first in September of 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines, and later, in March 2021, by the Montana commissioner of securities and insurance. Despite this, the defendants allegedly continued to promote the scheme while denying the claims in several YouTube videos and by other means.Two of the defendants, both of whom did not admit or deny the allegations, agreed to settle the charges, subject to court approval.watch nowVIDEO3:1003:10Can platforms with weak business models survive crypto contagion?Power Lunch] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida, on June 5, 2021.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFTX has been on the hunt to buy brokerage start-ups as the crypto exchange expands into stocks, and its CEO takes a major stake in Robinhood.The Bahamas-based company has approached at least three privately held trading start-ups about an acquisition, according to sources familiar with those negotiations, who asked not to be named because the deal talks were confidential. The discussions were still early and did not result in a term sheet, one source said.Webull, Apex Clearing and Public.com were among the companies FTX has spoken to in recent months, sources said. Webull, Apex and Public.com declined CNBC's requests for comment. FTX didn't respond to a comment request.The move comes as investors increasingly hold crypto and stocks, and brokerage firms look to offer the assets under one roof. Robinhood has pivoted its business model away from just stocks and focused on cryptocurrencies, while SoFi, Block and other fintechs now offer both.Last week, FTX said it would make a move into equities. It plans to offer commission-free trading in the U.S. in an effort to acquire more customers.\"The U.S. has the largest retail base in the world and you don't want to have to split into two different apps to trade two different asset classes,\" Brett Harrison, president of FTX U.S., told CNBC in a phone interview last week. \"This is not a revenue-generating model for us, it's more of a user acquisition strategy.\"FTX has already made strategic investments in the space. It bought a stake in IEX Group, one of the largest stock exchange operators, in April. Earlier in May, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried took a 7.6% stake in Robinhood fueling speculation that the crypto company may be looking at an acquisition. Robinhood shares are down more than 85% since reaching their all-time high around the initial public offering last summer.While a regulatory filing said Bankman-Fried sees Robinhood as an \"attractive investment\" with no plans to buy it or push changes at the company, the paperwork raised some eyebrows. The SEC filing was a 13D, is typically used by activist investors. Passive investors would normally file a 13G.Still, a Robinhood takeover may be a tough without the founders' blessing. Robinhood's dual-class share structure gives co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev and co-founder Baiju Bhatt more than 60% of the voting power.Analysts are expecting more consolidation in the space with fintech stocks plummeting from all-time highs and some private valuations compressing.\"Many in the industry are flush with cash and strategic acquisitions can accelerate growth, so we expect demand will remain strong,\" said Devin Ryan, director of financial technology research at JMP Securities. \"We expect buyers will be looking for targets that add a product capability and expertise, broaden the customer footprint as customer acquisition costs have risen, or even simply add talent in a competitive hiring landscape.\"] \n",

It also laid out requirements for those reserves, including the various assets the reserves should comprise and a specification that they be \"segregated from the proprietary assets of the issuing entity.\" Issuers should also submit to monthly audits by an independent certified public accountant.Regulators have focused on stablecoins in recent months due to the lack of transparency around trading these virtual assets and the reserves backing them, as well as market participants' reliance on them to enable trading in other crypto protocols.The meteoric rise of the Terra network's dollar-pegged stablecoin, TerraUSD, followed by its rapid collapse that led to $60 billion in investor losses also sharpened regulators' attention on the space.watch nowVIDEO5:2605:26How Terra's stablecoin collapsed and sent shockwaves through crypto marketsCrypto WorldTerraUSD is different from the stablecoins addressed in the New York regulators' guidance on Wednesday – it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin rather than one run by a single entity and backed by a fiat currency – but the saga has raised the profile of these crypto assets and has bruised the industry's reputation.\"We're now making it transparent and making clear to the marketplace that these are expectations for our stablecoin issuers across the board,\" Adrienne Harris, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, said on CNBC's \"Crypto World.\" [Watch CNBC's interview with Harris at 3 p.m. ET Wednesday on \"Crypto World.\"]\"The DFS has been regulating the space for a long time, but it's a fast-evolving and fast-moving space ... so it's incumbent upon us as a prudential regulator to make sure we are keeping pace with the innovation in that space,\" she said.New York's toughest regulatorAdrienne Harris, superintendent of New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS), speaks during an interview in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, May 25, 2022.Christopher Goodney | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe DFS, which regulates all financial services and products in New York, created the BitLicense in 2015 to regulate crypto businesses.Harris said the stablecoin guidance builds on Volt, a transformation initiative she launched to address delays in regulatory processes for the virtual currency businesses supervised by the agency. VOLT stands for vision, operations, leadership and technology, and the initiative includes a series of measures to address each of those.The superintendent said she's committed to making the agency's systems and processes run more smoothly as the crypto industry evolves. This includes upgrading the regulator's technology, using blockchain analytics and hiring talent at a rapid pace.\"Bringing in that talent is going to help us accelerate the licensing process without sacrificing the regulatory rigor that it requires, and then help us keep abreast of the space as it continues to move,\" Harris said.Still, with Harris just six months into the job, many wonder if New York will be welcoming to the crypto industry. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been vocal about plans to make the city a crypto hub.Critics of the New York financial regulator have also stressed that the state risks losing talent to other tech hubs like Miami or Austin, Texas, or states with crypto-forward regulatory initiatives like Wyoming. However, Harris said demand for BitLicenses has not waned, and she noted the agency has issued three licenses this year already.\"Half of venture capital investment in the cryptocurrency space in 2021, was in New York-based and regulated companies,\" Harris said. \"So we see that having clear rules of the road, having rigorous regulation attracts companies and attracts talent in New York. And that's our job, to make sure that we have those protections in place and that we want that talent and those companies to be here under that rubric.\" There are 22 BitLicensees to date, the agency confirmed. Some BitLicenses have been surrendered over time and are no longer effective. The DFS has also issued nine Limited Purpose Trust Charters to crypto companies.watch nowVIDEO8:1808:18How a $60 billion crypto collapse got regulators worriedCrypto] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell sharply as investors dump risk assets. A crypto lending company called Celsius is pausing withdrawals for its customers, sparking fears of contagion into the broader market.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCrypto has had a brutal first half of 2022, but few days have been this bad for the industry that's built itself up around digital currencies.On Monday, trading platforms halted withdrawals, companies cut jobs, and panicked investors dumped their holdings, dragging the market cap of crypto below $1 trillion, down from $3 trillion at its peak in November.Bitcoin plunged to an 18-month low, falling below $23,000. The most valuable cryptocurrency tumbled by 15% in the past 24 hours, while ethereum, which is second to bitcoin, fell 17%.The sell-off comes as investors rotate out of the riskiest assets due to macroeconomic headwinds and rising interest rates. But it's worse than that. The action on Monday showed a fundamental mistrust of cryptocurrencies and the platforms that support them. What was already a deep downturn started to look like panic selling.Here are some of Monday's crypto lowlights:The Celsius contagion effectFor weeks, concern has been growing that Celsius, one of the more popular crypto staking and lending platforms, is in the midst of a liquidity crunch. Celsius offers users yield of up to 18.63% on their deposits. It's like a product a bank would offer, except with none of the regulatory safeguards.Celsius' cel token dropped from over $7 to about 33 cents in the last year — and it's down more than 50% in the past week. Celsius is the biggest holder of the token.Meanwhile, the company's $26 billion in client funds has more than halved since October.watch nowVIDEO12:5012:50How Wall Street learned to love bitcoinCryptoCelsius had previously admitted to losing funds, though it didn't specify how much, as a result of the $120 million hack of decentralized finance platform BadgerDAO.Early Monday, Celsius shocked the market, announcing that all withdrawals, swaps, and transfers between accounts have been paused due to \"extreme market conditions.\" In a memo addressed to the Celsius Community, the platform also said the move was designed to \"stabilize liquidity and operations.\"\"We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honor, over time, its withdrawal obligations,\" the memo said.Celsius effectively locked up its $12 billion in crypto assets under management, raising concerns about the platform's solvency. The news rippled across the crypto industry, reminding some of what happened in May, when a failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project lost $60 billion in value and dragged the wider crypto industry down with it.Shares of crypto trading platform Coinbase dropped 11% on Monday to their lowest since the company went public in April 2021.Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it.

The world's largest crypto exchange halted bitcoin withdrawals for over three hours \"due to a stuck transaction causing a backlog.\"Although CEO Changpeng Zhao said the fix would only take a half hour, he later amended his estimate, saying it would take \"a bit longer\" than initially anticipated. By about 11:30 a.m., service had been restored.\"A batch of $BTC transactions got stuck due to low TX fees, resulting in a backlog of BTC network withdrawals,\" Binance wrote in a tweet.watch nowVIDEO8:1008:10What you should know before investing in cryptoInternational Digital OriginalsIn a series of post-mortem tweets, the exchange noted that deposits were \"unaffected\" and explained that the problem stemmed from scheduled repair work.Zhao assured customers that all funds were \"SAFU.\" That's a reference to the \"Secure Asset Fund for Users,\" which was set up by Binance in 2018 to protect users' holdings.During the withdrawal outage, Zhao tweeted that it was still possible for holders to take out their bitcoin on other networks like CEP-20.Layoffs ahead of 'crypto winter'Peter Thiel-backed start-up BlockFi has joined a growing list of crypto companies slashing costs by cutting jobs.On Monday, the company announced it would be reducing headcount by about 20%. Prior to the latest cuts, the company expanded from 150 employees at the end of 2020, to more than 850.CEO Zac Prince said in a tweet that BlockFi has been impacted by the \"dramatic shift in macroeconomic conditions,\" which have had a \"negative impact\" on growth.It's becoming a familiar theme for companies in the space.Late last week, Crypto.com announced a staff reduction of 260 people, just seven months after the company gained naming rights to the arena that's home to the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers in a $700 million deal. Earlier this month Gemini said it would be laying off 10% of its workforce and warned that the industry is in a \"contraction phase\" known as \"crypto winter.\"Meanwhile, Coinbase has extended its hiring pause for the \"foreseeable future\" and plans to rescind some job offers.WATCH: UST's crash has some investors reevaluating their crypto investmentswatch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO8:0608:06Crypto fund defaults on $670M loan, and Bitfury CEO says prices aren't 'relevant': CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto WorldCrypto prices should be viewed more like internet stocks than currency, said Brian Brooks, the former U.S. Acting Comptroller of the Currency during the Trump Administration.The biggest misunderstanding around cryptocurrencies is that if they're \"not doing a great job of replacing the U.S. dollar, then crypto is failing in its mission,\" Brooks, now the CEO of bitcoin mining and crypto tech company Bitfury Group, told CNBC's Ylan Muii at the Aspen Ideas Festival on Monday.\"Most of crypto is about replacing the centralized banking system with networks that allow user control versus bank control ... the crypto assets that have prices are more like internet stocks,\" Brooks said. \"It's more like you bet on Google if you think there's going to be high internet traffic; if you short it, it's that people are going to go back to the post office, right? But it's not that ethereum or Ripple or anything else is trying to replace the U.S. dollar, it's trying to replace the system of transmitting value,\" he said.The entire crypto market has slumped in 2022, leading to fears of another \"crypto winter.\" Several crypto and tech companies have quickly reversed hiring plans, while many, including leading exchange Coinbase, have laid off workers amid the slide in crypto prices and trading.It has also led many in the industry to forecast that potentially thousands of digital tokens could collapse, a concern that only grew following the recent collapse of so-called algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and its associated digital token luna. There are more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and dozens of blockchain platforms that exist, according to CNBC research.The Terra issue showed \"we're at the stage where basically there are far too many blockchains out there, too many tokens. And that's confusing users. And that's also bringing some risks for the users,\" Bertrand Perez, CEO of the Web3 Foundation, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month.watch nowVIDEO8:1808:18How a $60 billion crypto collapse got regulators worriedCrypto\"Like at the beginning of the internet, you were having lots of dotcom companies and lots of them were scams, and were not bringing any value and all that got cleared. And now we have very useful and legit companies,\" Perez said.Brooks said that it is worth noting that even amid the crash in prices, bitcoin has still outperformed the S&P 500 by 5x in the last 12 months, and that there isn't a session about \"the future of U.S. equities\" at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Bitcoin is down more than 56% year-to-date.But even amid those sharp changes in valuation, the pricing of cryptocurrencies is \"not that relevant any more than Google's volatility,\" he said.\"The value of these tokens you're getting is related to the adoption rate of the underlying [technology], that tens of millions of people are transacting bitcoin, the value of bitcoin goes way up,\" he said. \"That is why bitcoin isn't going to stay at $20,000 because more and more people use it. Same with a lot of other things,\" Brooks said. \"The value of the network is what drives the value of the token,\" he added.Brooks, who signed the first regulatory guidance that defined what a stablecoin was and how it would be allowed inside the U.S. banking system, said that \"stablecoins will become what people think of bank deposits today.\"\"These will be bank deposits that don't have a minimum balance fee, don't have a monthly maintenance fee, don't have a transaction fee,\" Brooks said, noting that he thinks stablecoins will have a significant impact for lower-income Americans as a result.Disclosure: NBCUniversal News Group is the media partner of the Aspen Ideas Festival.] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [The entire stablecoin market is now worth more than $160 billion.Justin Tallis | AFP via Getty ImagesThe co-founders of failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital appear to be on the run from creditors, according to court documents recently filed in New York.Lawyers representing the creditors say the physical whereabouts of Zhu Su and Kyle Davies, who started Three Arrows in 2012, are \"currently unknown,\" ahead of a hearing that is scheduled for 9 a.m. ET on Tuesday to discuss next steps in the liquidation process. The documents, filed Friday evening, also allege that the founders have not yet begun to cooperate with the liquidation process \"in any meaningful manner.\" On Monday, lawyers requested the court keep the identity of the creditors anonymous.Zhu and Davies did not respond to requests for comment.Three Arrows, also known as 3AC, managed about $10 billion in assets as recently as March. On July 1, the firm filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection from U.S. creditors in the Southern District of New York, after a plunge in cryptocurrencies and the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin project wiped out its assets.Prior to the bankruptcy filing, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered the beleaguered fund to liquidate in order to pay back its debts.watch nowVIDEO12:1412:14Excessive leverage is the main culprit behind crypto meltdown: The Bitcoin Layer founderCrypto WorldNow, 3AC is in bankruptcy court, facing angry lenders who want their money back. Global advisory firm Teneo was hired to help manage the liquidation, starting with trying to determine what was left.According to Friday's court filing, Zhu and Davies, both former traders for Credit Suisse, participated in an introductory Zoom call last week to discuss basic steps to preserve their assets. Neither founder turned on his video, and both remained muted for the duration, with all dialogue conducted through counsel. Their lawyers said at the time that they \"intended to cooperate.\"During the meeting, representatives helping to facilitate the liquidation requested immediate access to 3AC's offices and to information related to their bank accounts and digital wallets. As of Friday, that access had not been granted, the filing says.When the fund's liquidators previously arrived at 3AC's Singapore office in late June in an attempt to meet with the founders, \"the offices appeared vacant except for a number of inactive computer screens.\"The filing notes that while the office door was locked, the representatives could view unopened mail addressed to Three Arrows, which \"appeared to have been pushed under the door or propped against the door.\" Neighbors in surrounding offices said they had last seen people in the 3AC office in early June.Meanwhile, creditors are trying to determine what assets remain.Teneo's Russell Crumpler, who was tasked with helping to facilitate the bankruptcy process, said in a sworn statement that there is a \"real risk\" that 3AC's assets would disappear \"absent immediate authority to pursue discovery.\"\"That risk is heightened because a substantial portion of the Debtor's assets are comprised of cash and digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens, that are readily transferrable,\" Crumpler said in his statement.There are reasons for such concern. One of 3AC's NFTs was transferred to another crypto wallet, according to a well-known NFT collector and investor.In Friday's filing, creditors requested that the court suspend 3AC's right to transfer or dispose of any assets. Attorneys are also asking that the court subpoena the founders or others who may have information about 3AC's assets. That could include banks, crypto exchanges and counterparties.3AC's insolvency has already had a major impact on the broader crypto market, because so many institutions had money wrapped up with the firm.Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after 3AC couldn't pay back the roughly $670 million it had borrowed from the company. U.S.-based crypto lenders Genesis and BlockFi, crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and crypto exchange FTX are also being hit with losses.— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.

      "capsula.article_text [A bystander uses a Bitcoin ATM in San Salvador, El Salvador, on May 16, 2022.Alex Pena | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesEl Salvador bet its economic salvation on bitcoin, but so far the gamble isn't paying off like President Nayib Bukele hoped it would.The government's crypto coffers have been cut in half, bitcoin adoption nationwide isn't really taking off, and crucially, the country needs a lot of cash, fast, to meet its debt payments of more than $1 billion in the next year. This comes as the price of bitcoin has fallen more than 70% from its November 2021 peak, and more than 55% from the time Bukele announced his plan.Meanwhile, El Salvador's economic growth has plummeted, its deficit remains high, and the country's debt-to-GDP ratio — a key metric used to compare what a country owes to what it generates — is set to hit nearly 87% this year, stoking fears that El Salvador isn't equipped to settle its loan obligations.Pair these economic woes with a renewed war on gang violence, and you have all the fixings of a country on the brink.\"On the surface, the whole bitcoin thing hasn't really paid off,\" said Boaz Sobrado, a London-based fintech data analyst.It isn't bitcoin's fault that the government is edging toward financial ruin.The government has an unrealized paper loss on bitcoin of around $50 million, which the finance minister notes is less than 0.5% of the national budget. In aggregate, the entire experiment (and all its associated costs) have only run the government around $374 million, according to estimates. That's not nothing — especially considering the fact that El Salvador has $7.7 billion of bonds outstanding — but to an economy of $29 billion, it is comparatively small.The optics aren't good, though.Negotiations have stalled with international lenders in part because they are unwilling to throw money at a country that is spending millions in tax dollars on a cryptocurrency whose price is prone to extreme volatility. Rating agencies, including Fitch, have knocked down El Salvador's credit score citing the uncertainty of the country's financial future, given the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. That means that it's now even more expensive for President Bukele to borrow much-needed cash.\"In terms of their financial situation, El Salvador is in a very difficult place. They have a lot of bonds that are trading severely discounted,\" continued Sobrado.\"The economic policy of the country is essentially magical thinking,\" said Frank Muci, a policy fellow at the London School of Economics, who has experience advising governments in Latin America.\"They've spooked the bejesus out of financial markets and the IMF,\" continued Muci, who tells CNBC that nobody wants to lend money to Bukele unless it's at \"eye-gouging rates\" of 20% to 25%.\"The country is sleepwalking into a debt default,\" said Muci.But the millennial, tech-savvy president, who once touted himself as the \"world's coolest dictator\" on his Twitter bio, has tethered his political fate to this crypto gamble, so there is a very big incentive to make it work in the long run — and to pay off the country's debt in the interim. Bukele faces re-election for another five-year presidential term in 2024.watch nowVIDEO4:1004:10Why El Salvador's bitcoin law faces slow adoption from consumers and businessesCrypto WorldSnapshot of the Salvadoran economyWell before President Bukele got it in his head that bitcoin was a magical elixir that would bandage over longstanding economic vulnerabilities, the country was in a lot of trouble.The World Bank projects that the Salvadoran economy will grow by 2.9% this year and 1.9% in 2023, down from 10.7% in 2021. But that growth itself was a bounceback from an 8.6% contraction in 2020.Its debt-to-GDP ratio is almost 90%, and its debt is expensive at around 5% per year versus 1.5% in the U.S. The country also has a massive deficit — with no plans to reduce it, whether through tax hikes or by substantially cutting spending.In a research note from JPMorgan, analysts warn that El Salvador's Eurobonds have entered \"distressed territory\" in the last year, and S&P Global data reportedly shows that the cost to insure against a sovereign debt default is hitting multi-year highs.Both JPMorgan and the International Monetary Fund warn the country is on an unsustainable path, with gross financing needs set to surpass 15% of GDP from 2022 forward — and public debt on track to hit 96% of GDP by 2026 under current policies.\"In the past three, four months, what they've done is implement gasoline subsidies, which are super expensive,\" said Muci, who has expertise in economic diversification and public financial management, and has taken part in applied research projects for El Salvador, Venezuela, and Honduras.\"This is a country that's rudderless in terms of economic policy. I mean, they don't know where they're going, or what they're doing. I think it's a classic case of one day at a time,\" he said.All this comes as El Salvador faces imminent debt repayment deadlines in the billions of dollars, including an $800 million Eurobond that matures in January.El Salvador has been trying since early 2021 to secure a $1.3 billion dollar loan from the IMF — an effort that appears to have soured over President Bukele's refusal to heed the organization's advice to ditch bitcoin as legal tender. This tracks with Fitch's recent downgrade, which was also attributed to El Salvador's \"uncertain access to multilateral funding and external market financing given high borrowing costs,\" plus its \"limited scope for additional local market financing.\"The president's efforts to consolidate power have also driven up this risk premium. Bukele's New Ideas party has control over the country's Legislative Assembly. In 2021, the new assembly came under fire after it ousted the attorney general and top judges. The move prompted the U.S. Agency for International Development to pull aid from El Salvador's national police and a public information institute, instead re-routing funds to civil society groups.Additionally, El Salvador can't print cash to shore up its finances. El Salvador dollarized in 2001, meaning that it ditched its local currency, the colón, in favor of the U.S. dollar. Only the Federal Reserve can print more dollars. Meanwhile, its other national currency, bitcoin, is revered for the fact that it, too, is impossible to mint out of thin air.watch nowVIDEO1:5301:53El Salvador is using volcano power to mine bitcoinThe ExchangeThe bitcoin experimentIn Sept. 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.The initiative involved buying bitcoin with public funds, as well as launching a national virtual wallet called \"chivo\" (Salvadoran slang for \"cool\") that offers no-fee transactions and allows for quick cross-border payments. For a country that is a largely cash economy — where roughly 70% of people do not have bank accounts, credit cards, or other traditional financial services — chivo was meant to offer a convenient onramp for those who had never been a part of the banking system.The experiment also involved building a nationwide infrastructure of bitcoin ATMs across the country and requiring all businesses to accept the cryptocurrency.The president upped the ante in November when he announced plans to build a \"Bitcoin City\" next-door to the Conchagua volcano in south eastern El Salvador. The bitcoin-funded city would offer significant tax relief, and geothermal energy rolling off the adjacent volcano would power bitcoin miners.All in, the government has spent about $375 million on the bitcoin rollout, including a $150 million trust designed to convert bitcoin instantly into dollars, $120 million on the $30 bitcoin bonus given to each citizen who downloaded the chivo wallet (no small sum in a country where the monthly minimum wage is $365), and the roughly $104 million the government has publicly admitted to spending on bitcoin. Muci notes that these expenses plus the $50 million in unrealized losses on the country's bitcoin portfolio means that the country has spent around $425 million on \"making bitcoin happen.\"But nine months in to this nationwide bet on bitcoin, and it doesn't appear to immediately be delivering on a lot of its big promises.President Bukele tweeted in January that the app had 4 million users (out of a total population of 6.5 million), but a report published in April by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research showed that only 20% of those who downloaded the wallet continued to use it after spending the $30 bonus. The research was based upon a \"nationally representative survey\" involving 1,800 households.​​\"In terms of actual penetration of bitcoin transactions, it seems to be quite low,\" explained Sobrado. \"There seem to have been issues with regards to the state-issued wallets. Lots of people downloaded it, but it was buggy. It wasn't really the best user experience.\"Of those who did use the government's crypto wallet, some had technical problems with the app. Other Salvadorans reported cases of identity theft, in which hackers used their national ID number to open a chivo e-wallet, in order to claim the free $30 worth of bitcoin offered by the government as an incentive to join.Another hope for the chivo wallet was that it would help save hundreds of millions of dollars in remittance fees. Remittances, or the money sent home by migrants, account for more than 20% of El Salvador's gross domestic product, and some households receive over 60% of their income from this source alone. Incumbent services can charge 10% or more in fees for those international transfers, which can sometimes take days to arrive and require a physical pick-up.But in 2022, recent data shows that only 1.6% of remittances were sent via digital wallets.In terms of merchant adoption, a survey published in March by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador found that 86% of businesses have never made a sale in bitcoin.\"They gave people the wallets, they forced businesses to accept them, but essentially, in my opinion, it's a big nothing burger,\" said Muci, who previously worked at the Growth Lab at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. \"Nobody really uses the app to pay in bitcoin. People that do use it, mostly use it for dollars.\"Bitcoin City is on hold, as is the $1 billion bitcoin bond sale, which was initially put on ice in March because of unfavorable market conditions.If the president's tweets are to be believed, then the government's personal bitcoin investment is down about $50 million on paper. (None of these losses are locked in until the country exits its bitcoin position.)\"Ultimately, El Salvador's problems are just tangential to currency,\" said Muci.\"The issues have to do with security, economic productivity and other things. And bitcoin has nothing to do with any of that,\" he said.watch nowVIDEO4:5104:51What El Salvador's bitcoin rollout could mean for mainstream adoptionSquawk on the StreetDebt default unlikelyEl Salvador's big bitcoin gamble may be struggling at the moment, but Sobrado tells CNBC that it has undoubtedly been a win in terms of attracting bitcoin tourists.\"While they might be down in terms of unrealized losses in their bitcoin investment, they are extremely up in terms of tourism,\" said Sobrado.\"They have attracted a lot of people who are bitcoin believers and a lot of capital from these people. And I think it is entirely possible that if you think of the unrealized losses as a marketing campaign, El Salvador has already achieved what it wanted to,\" continued Sobrado, who also noted that countries like Costa Rica spend billions of dollars on marketing campaigns.The tourism industry is up 30% since the Bitcoin Law took effect in September, according to official government estimates. The country's tourism minister also notes that 60% of tourists now come from the U.S.The bitcoin experiment also hasn't hurt the president's popularity. Bukele's approval ratings are north of 85% — thanks in large part to his tough-on-crime approach to leading. That's no small thing to a country that was more dangerous per capita than Afghanistan five years ago.\"Mr. Bukele is, to this day, one of the most popular presidents that is in power,\" said Sobrado. \"He has approval rates of 80 plus percent, that people in other parts of the world just dream of.\"As for the country's oppressive levels of debt, virtually everyone agrees that President Bukele will do whatever it takes to pull together enough cash to make good on what the country owes this year and next. A big part of that incentive comes from the upcoming presidential election in 2024, in which Bukele is vying for another five-year term.JPMorgan sees a \"high likelihood\" of that $800 million bond maturity being paid in January, in order to \"avoid disruptive credit events that might derail his prospects for a potential re-election.\" Although Fitch expects El Salvador to meet its near-term debt service payments, the credit agency warns that keeping pace with its loans will prove \"more onerous as the year progresses.\"Muci agrees that El Salvador will be able to scrape together the cash, but he warns that ultimately the country's public finance situation is unsustainable.\"The plane is gonna crash eventually, if they don't change things,\" said Muci. \"If they don't raise taxes, cut spending, start being much more disciplined. You know, convincing markets that they're sustainable.\"He added, \"Bitcoin doesn't solve any of El Salvador's important economic problems.\"watch nowVIDEO3:3203:32A look at El Salvador's crypto experiment after making bitcoin its national currencySquawk Box] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [In this articleSOL.CM=Follow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTThe logo of cryptocurrency platform Solana.Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto via | Getty ImagesNearly 8,000 digital wallets have been drained of just over $5.2 million in digital coins including solana's sol token and USD Coin (USDC), according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The Twitter account Solana Status confirmed the attack, noting that as of Wednesday morning, approximately 7,767 wallets have been affected by the exploit. Elliptic's estimate is slightly higher at 7,936 wallets.Solana's sol token, one of the largest cryptocurrencies after bitcoin and ether, fell about 8% in the first two hours after the hack was initially detected, according to data from CoinMarketCap. It's currently down about 1%, while trading volume is up about 105% in the last 24 hours.Starting Tuesday evening, multiple users began reporting that assets held in \"hot\" wallets — that is, internet-connected addresses, including Phantom, Slope and Trust Wallet — had been emptied of funds.watch nowVIDEO6:5106:51Progress on crypto regulation and a big hack for SolanaFast MoneyPhantom said on Twitter that it's investigating the \"reported vulnerability in the solana ecosystem\" and doesn't believe it's a Phantom-specific issue. Blockchain audit firm OtterSec tweeted that the hack has affected multiple wallets \"across a wide variety of platforms.\"Elliptic chief scientist Tom Robinson told CNBC the root cause of the breach is still unclear, but \"it appears to be due to a flaw in certain wallet software, rather than in the solana blockchain itself.\" OtterSec added that the transactions were being signed by the actual owners, \"suggesting some sort of private key compromise.\" A private key is a secure code that grants the owner access to their crypto holdings.The identity of the attacker is still unknown, as is the root cause of the exploit. The breach is ongoing.\"Engineers from multiple ecosystems, with the help of several security firms, are investigating drained wallets on solana,\" according to Solana Status, a Twitter account that shares updates for the entire solana network.The solana network is strongly encouraging users to use hardware wallets, since there's no evidence those have been impacted.\"Do not reuse your seed phrase on a hardware wallet - create a new seed phrase. Wallets drained should be treated as compromised, and abandoned,\" reads one tweet. Seed phrases are a collection of random words generated by a crypto wallet when it is first set up, and it grants access to the wallet.A private key is unique and links a user to their blockchain address. A seed phrase is a fingerprint of all of a user's blockchain assets that is used as a backup if a crypto wallet is lost.The incident comes one day after the $200 million hack of the Nomad blockchain bridge. It's the latest crisis to grip the crypto market in recent weeks.\"Four addresses are currently linked to the hacker, a far cry from yesterday's 'decentralized looting,' which involved over 120 individual users,\" said crypto investor and analyst Miles Deutscher. \"This implies that it was a singular party who conducted the SOL exploit, although the specific details remain ambiguous.\"The Solana network was viewed as one of the most promising newcomers in the crypto market, with backers like Chamath Palihapitiya and Andreessen Horowitz touting it as a challenger to ethereum with faster transaction processing times and enhanced security. But it's been faced with a spate of issues lately, including downtime in periods of activity and a perception of being more centralized than ethereum. A major outage in June knocked the Solana platform offline for several hours.Ether, the native token of the ethereum blockchain, climbed 6% in 24 hours.watch nowVIDEO3:4403:44Crypto Crackdown: Why federal charges over an alleged Ponzi scheme may only be the tip of the icebergWorldwide Exchange] \n",

The world's two most popular cryptocurrencies are down more than 35% in the past week, as both breach symbolic price barriers.Bitcoin bounced back to around $18,955 and ether was trading at about $995 just after 8 p.m. ET.The carnage in the crypto market is partly caused by pressure from macroeconomic forces, including spiraling inflation and a succession of Fed rate hikes. We have also seen these blue chip cryptos track equities lower. It doesn't help that crypto firms are laying off large swaths of employees, and some of the most popular names in the industry are facing solvency meltdowns.Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 in November. Ether peaked at $4,891.70 that same month. Bitcoin last traded this low around December 2020.Here's how we got here.MondayCelsius on Thursday was sued by former investment manager Jason Stone, as pressure continues to mount on the firm amid a crash in cryptocurrency prices. Stone has alleged, among other things, that Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky (above) was \"able to enrich himself considerably.\"Piaras Ó Mídheach | Sportsfile for Web Summit | Getty ImagesThe week started with crypto prices plummeting, and bitcoin falling as much as 17% at one point in the day. It seemed like the crypto winter was here.In the chaos, Celsius, a major crypto staking and lending firm, shocked the market when it announced that all withdrawals, swaps and transfers between accounts have been paused due to \"extreme market conditions.\" In a memo addressed to the Celsius Community, the platform also said the move was designed to \"stabilize liquidity and operations.\"Celsius effectively locked up its $12 billion in crypto assets under management, raising concerns about the platform's solvency. The news rippled across the crypto industry, reminding some of what happened in May, when a failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project lost $60 billion in value and dragged the wider crypto industry down with it.Celsius was known for offering users a yield of up to 18.63% on their deposits. It's like a product a bank would offer, except with none of the regulatory safeguards.Those crazy high yields were what eventually came under scrutiny.\"This risk certainly seems like it's just the beginning,\" said John Todaro, Needham's vice president of crypto assets and blockchain research.\"What I would say is on the decentralized side — a lot of these DeFi protocols, a lot of those positions are over collateralized, so you shouldn't quite see the underfunding situation that could happen with centralized borrowers and lenders. But that being said, you could still see a lot of liquidations with that collateral being sold off on DeFi protocols,\" continued Todaro.TuesdayPeople watch as the logo for Coinbase Global Inc, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is displayed on the Nasdaq MarketSite jumbotron at Times Square in New York, U.S., April 14, 2021.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersCrypto markets appeared to stabilize on Tuesday, with bitcoin hovering at around $22,000 and ether at around $1,100.Investors were assessing the fallout of Celsius, and meanwhile, another crypto firm joined a growing list of companies cutting staff to try to shore up profits.Coinbase announced it was laying off nearly a fifth of its workforce due to crypto volatility. The company had previously cut spending and even rescinded job offers in the hopes of stabilizing its business.\"We had the recent inflation report that came out that I think surprised many folks,\" explained President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi.\"We've had Jamie Dimon and others talk about an upcoming economic hurricane and so given what's happening in the economy, it feels like the most prudent thing to do right now,\" continued Choi.Crypto companies across the board are looking for ways to cut costs, as investors rotate out of the riskiest assets, pulling down trading volumes.Crypto.com recently announced a staff reduction of 260 people, as did Gemini, which said it would lay off 10% of its workforce — a first for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange and custodian. WednesdayMichael Saylor, chairman and chief executive officer of MicroStrategy, first got into bitcoin in 2020, when he decided to start adding the cryptocurrency to MicroStrategy's balance sheet as part of an unorthodox treasury management strategy.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor appeared on CNBC Wednesday morning to discuss concerns around his firm, which has made a $4 billion bet on bitcoin. Saylor has said the company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S., so investing in MicroStrategy is the closest you'll get to a bitcoin spot ETF.MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral — to then buy more of the cryptocurrency.\"We have $5 billion in collateral. We borrowed $200 million. So I'm not telling people to go out and take a highly leveraged loan. What I am doing, I think, is doing my best to lead the way and to normalize the bitcoin-backed financing industry,\" said Saylor, who added that publicly traded crypto miner Marathon Digital also took out a credit line with Silvergate Bank.As bitcoin prices tanked this week, investors worried the company would be asked to put up more collateral for its loan, but Saylor said the fears were overblown.\"The margin call is much ado about nothing,\" Saylor told CNBC earlier this week. \"It's just made me Twitter famous, so I appreciate that...We feel like we have a fortress balance sheet, we're comfortable, and the margin loan is well managed.\"Then on Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point in its most aggressive hike since 1994. The Fed said the move was made in an effort to curb sky-high inflation.Crypto prices initially rallied on the news as investors hoped we could avoid a recession, but that rally was short-lived.Thursday       Dan Kitwood | Getty ImagesWe were back in the red on Thursday. Bitcoin fell to around $20,000, to prices it hadn't seen since the end of 2020.The losses were closely tied to a sell-off on Wall Street, in which the Dow fell 700 points to its lowest level in more than a year.It appears that investors can't shake the fears of recession, and some say it could take time for cryptocurrencies to recover from the sell-off in riskier assets.\"I think that we're in a long drawdown period here,\" Jill Gunter, Espresso Systems co-founder & chief strategy officer, told CNBC's Squawk on the Street.\"I think that we've taken the elevator down, and I think that we, as an industry, are going to have to take the stairs back up and climb out by building real utility,\" she said.Gunter said that, in many ways, what we're seeing is a \"healthy washout.\"\"One doesn't want to, as a builder, as an investor for the long-term... be in a market where it's being driven by just short-term price action, by speculation, as, let's be honest, the crypto market has been largely over the last couple of years,\" continued Gunter.Friday into SaturdayBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell sharply as investors dump risk assets. A crypto lending company called Celsius is pausing withdrawals for its customers, sparking fears of contagion into the broader market.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCarnage in the crypto markets shows no signs of slowing down, as bitcoin and ether continue their sell-off at a rapid clip on Saturday afternoon.This comes as crypto hedge funds and businesses face growing questions about insolvency.\"We had financial instability because of this opaque leverage, you just couldn't tell where all these risks were building up,\" Paxos CEO & Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla told CNBC.\"In some ways, this is just an age old story. You're borrowing short and lending long. And I think it's really unfortunate that people lost money, and I think it will, in some ways, set back the space, because you will lose some early adopters or some of the people who just came in new to the space,\" continued Cascarilla.But Cascarilla also says that investors are still looking for quality crypto investments.\"The fundamental technology here and the adoption curve that we see, the institutions that are coming in, how you can get your financial system to operate at the speed of the internet, those are things that need to happen,\" he said.Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it.

      "capsula.article_text [Mining the Worlds Second-most-valuable Cryptocurrency at Evobits I.T SRL An engineer inspects Sapphire Technology Ltd. AMD graphics processing units (GPU) at the Evobits crypto farm in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2021. The worlds second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, rallied 75% this year, outpacing its larger rival Bitcoin. Photographer: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesPhotographer: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesCrypto investors have been hit hard this year by hacks and scams. One reason is that cybercriminals have found a particularly useful avenue to reach them: bridges.Blockchain bridges, which tenuously connect networks to enable the fast swaps of tokens, are gaining popularity as a way for crypto users to transact. But in using them, crypto enthusiasts are bypassing a centralized exchange and using a system that's largely unprotected.A total of around $1.4 billion has been lost to breaches on these cross-chain bridges since the start of the year, according to figures from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The biggest single event was the record $615 million haul snatched from Ronin, a bridge supporting the popular nonfungible token game Axie Infinity, which lets users earn money as they play.There was also the $320 million stolen from Wormhole, a crypto bridge backed by Wall Street high-frequency trading firm Jump Trading. In June, Harmony's Horizon bridge suffered a $100 million attack. And last week, almost $200 million was seized by hackers in a breach targeting Nomad.\"Blockchain bridges have become the low-hanging fruit for cyber-criminals, with billions of dollars worth of crypto assets locked within them,\" said Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, in an interview. \"These bridges have been breached by hackers in a variety of ways, suggesting that their level of security has not kept pace with the value of assets that they hold.\"The bridge exploits are occurring at a striking rate, considering it's such a new phenomenon. According to Chainalysis data, the amount stolen in bridge heists accounts for 69% of funds stolen in crypto-related hacks so far in 2022.How bridges workA bridge is a piece of software that allows someone to send tokens out of one blockchain network and receive them on a separate chain. Blockchains are the distributed ledger systems that underpin various cryptocurrencies.When swapping a token from one chain onto another — as in sending some ether from ethereum to the solana network — an investor deposits the tokens into a smart contract, a piece of code on the blockchain that enables agreements to execute automatically without human intervention.That crypto then gets \"minted\" on a new blockchain in the form of a so-called wrapped token, which represents a claim on the original ether coins. The token can then be traded on a new network. That can be useful for investors using ethereum, which has become notorious for sudden spikes in fees and longer wait times when the network is busy.\"They usually hold tremendous amounts of money,\" said Adrian Hetman, tech lead at crypto security firm Immunefi. \"Those amounts of money, and how much traffic goes through bridges, are a very enticing point of attack.\"Why they're under attackThe vulnerability of bridges can be traced in part to sloppy engineering.The hack on Harmony's Horizon bridge, for example, was possible because of the limited number of validators that were required for approving transactions. Hackers only needed to compromise two out of a total of five accounts to obtain the passwords necessary for withdrawing funds.A similar situation occurred with Ronin. Hackers only needed to convince five out of nine validators on the network to hand over their private keys to gain access to crypto locked inside the system.In Nomad's case, the bridge was much simpler for hackers to manipulate. Attackers were able to enter any value into the system and then withdraw funds, even if there weren't enough assets deposited in the bridge. They didn't need any programming skills, and their exploits led copycats to pile in, leading to the eighth-largest crypto theft of all time, according to Elliptic.watch nowVIDEO1:5201:52Wormhole Network hack named fourth biggest crypto hack of all timeSquawk on the StreetNomad is offering hackers a bounty of up to 10% to retrieve user funds and says it will abstain from pursuing legal action against any hackers who return 90% of the assets they took.Nomad told CNBC it's \"committed to keeping its community updated as it learns more\" and \"appreciates all those who acted quickly to protect funds.\"Why they're importantBridges are an essential tool in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, which is crypto's alternative to the banking system.With DeFi, instead of centralized players calling the shots, the exchanges of money are managed by a programmable piece of code called a smart contract. This contract is written on a public blockchain, such as ethereum or solana, and it executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. \"We cannot simply move those assets,\" Hetman said. \"That's why we need blockchain bridges.\"As the DeFi space continues to evolve, developers will need to make blockchains interoperable to ensure that assets and data can flow smoothly between networks.\"Without them, assets are locked on native chains,\" said Auston Bunsen, co-founder of QuikNode, which provides blockchain infrastructure to developers and companies.But they're risky.\"They're effectively ungoverned,\" said David Carlisle, head of regulatory affairs at Elliptic. They're \"very vulnerable to hacks, or to being used in crimes like money laundering.\"Criminals have transferred at least $540 million worth of ill-gotten gains through a bridge called RenBridge since 2020, according to new research that Elliptic provided to CNBC.\"One major question is whether bridges will become subject to regulation, since they act a lot like crypto exchanges, which are already regulated,\" Carlisle said.This week the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, announced sanctions against Tornado Cash, a popular cryptocurrency mixer, banning Americans from using the service. Mixers are tools that blend a user's tokens with a pool of other funds to conceal the identities of individuals and entities involved.Carlisle said it's becoming evident that \"U.S. regulators are prepared to go after DeFi services that facilitate illicit activity.\"WATCH: Adrian Hetman of Immunefi explains how hackers stole $200 millionwatch nowVIDEO9:1209:12Adrian Hetman of Immunefi explains how hackers stole $200 million from Nomad's bridgeCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO9:0209:02Bitcoin dips, Saylor dubs ether a security, and what caused crypto's crash: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto WorldAs recently as March, Three Arrows Capital managed about $10 billion in assets, making it one of the most prominent crypto hedge funds in the world.Now the firm, also known as 3AC, is headed to bankruptcy court after the plunge in cryptocurrency prices and a particularly risky trading strategy combined to wipe out its assets and leave it unable to repay lenders.The chain of pain may just be beginning. 3AC had a lengthy list of counterparties, or companies that had their money wrapped up in the firm's ability to at least stay afloat. With the crypto market down by more than $1 trillion since April, led by the slide in bitcoin and ethereum, investors with concentrated bets on firms like 3AC are suffering the consequences.Crypto exchange Blockchain.com reportedly faces a $270 million hit on loans to 3AC. Meanwhile, digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after 3AC couldn't pay back the roughly $670 million it had borrowed from the company. U.S.-based crypto lenders Genesis and BlockFi, crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and crypto exchange FTX are also being hit with losses.\"Credit is being destroyed and withdrawn, underwriting standards are being tightened, solvency is being tested, so everyone is withdrawing liquidity from crypto lenders,\" said Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, which focuses on blockchain investments.Three Arrows' strategy involved borrowing money from across the industry and then turning around and investing that capital in other, often nascent, crypto projects. The firm had been around for a decade, which helped give founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies a measure of credibility in an industry populated by newbies. Zhu also co-hosted a popular podcast on crypto.\"3AC was supposed to be the adult in the room,\" said Nik Bhatia, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California.Court documents reviewed by CNBC show that lawyers representing 3AC's creditors claim that Zhu and Davies have not yet begun to cooperate with them \"in any meaningful manner.\" The filing also alleges that the liquidation process hasn't started, meaning there's no cash to pay back the company's lenders.Zhu and Davies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Tracing the falling dominoesThe fall of Three Arrows Capital can be traced to the collapse in May of terraUSD (UST), which had been one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin projects.The stability of UST relied on a complex set of code, with very little hard cash to back up the arrangement, despite the promise that it would keep its value regardless of the volatility in the broader crypto market. Investors were incentivized — on an accompanying lending platform called Anchor — with 20% annual yield on their UST holdings, a rate many analysts said was unsustainable.Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwards\"The risk asset correction coupled with less liquidity have exposed projects that promised high unsustainable APRs, resulting in their collapse, such as UST,\" said Alkesh Shah, global crypto and digital asset strategist at Bank of America.Panic selling associated with the fall of UST, and its sister token luna, cost investors $60 billion.\"The terraUSD and luna collapse is ground zero,\" said USC's Bhatia, who published a book last year on digital currencies titled \"Layered Money.\" He described the meltdown as the first domino to fall in a \"long, nightmarish chain of leverage and fraud.\"3AC told the Wall Street Journal it had invested $200 million in luna. Other industry reports said the fund's exposure was around $560 million. Whatever the loss, that investment was rendered virtually worthless when the stablecoin project failed.watch nowVIDEO8:1808:18How a $60 billion crypto collapse got regulators worriedCryptoUST's implosion rocked confidence in the sector and accelerated the slide in cryptocurrencies already underway as part of a broader pullback from risk.3AC's lenders asked for some of their cash back in a flood of margin calls, but the money wasn't there. Many of the firm's counterparties were, in turn, unable to meet demands from their investors, including retail holders who had been promised annual returns of 20%.\"Not only were they not hedging anything, but they also evaporated billions in creditors' funds,\" said Bhatia.Peter Smith, the CEO of Blockchain.com said last week, in a letter to shareholders viewed by CoinDesk, that his company's exchange \"remains liquid, solvent and our customers will not be impacted.\" But investors have heard that kind of sentiment before — Voyager said the same thing days before it filed for bankruptcy.Bhatia said the cascade hits any player in the market with significant exposure to a deteriorating asset and liquidity crunch. And crypto comes with so few consumer protections that retail investors have no idea what, if anything, they'll end up owning.Customers of Voyager Digital recently received an email indicating that it would be a while before they could access the crypto held in their accounts. CEO Stephen Ehrlich said on Twitter that after the company goes through bankruptcy proceedings, customers with crypto in their account would potentially receive a sort of grab bag of stuff.That could include a combination of the crypto they held, common shares in the reorganized Voyager, Voyager tokens and whatever proceeds they're able to get from 3AC. Voyager investors told CNBC they don't see much reason for optimism.WATCH: Voyager Digital files for bankruptcy amid crypto lender solvency crisiswatch nowVIDEO3:0803:08Voyager Digital files for bankruptcy amid crypto lender solvency crisisWorldwide Exchange] \n",

The company's president, Phong Le, will take the reins from Saylor.Saylor has been in the role of chief executive since launching the company in 1989. MicroStrategy went public in 1998.MicroStrategy's stock is down over 48% this year. Bitcoin is down over 51% during that same time period.\"I believe that splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO will enable us to better pursue our two corporate strategies of acquiring and holding bitcoin and growing our enterprise analytics software business. As Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations,\" said Mr. Saylor in the release.The announcement comes as the company announces its second quarter earnings, in which its total revenues dropped by 2.6% compared to a year ago. The company also reported an impairment charge of $918 million on the value of its digital assets, presumably primarily bitcoin.MicroStrategy may technically be in the business of enterprise software and cloud-based services, but Saylor has said the publicly traded company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\"We're kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,\" Saylor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami in April.So far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has only approved ETFs that track contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin, instead of the cryptocurrency itself. The commission has refused to greenlight any of the formal applications for a pure-play bitcoin-based ETF — a financial instrument that would give investors the chance to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the motions of signing up for an exchange, opening a crypto wallet, or dealing with any of the other logistics involved with buying and holding bitcoin.\"If there was a spot ETF, you'd be paying a 1% fee, and it wouldn't be leveraged. With MicroStrategy, we have a software company that generates cash flow, so we convert our cash flows into bitcoin,\" said Saylor in April.MicroStrategy has been adding bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet for the last two years. The company has now spent close to $4 billion acquiring bitcoin at an average price of $30,700.MicroStrategy has used company debt to purchase bitcoin, and in March, Saylor decided to take another step toward normalizing bitcoin-backed finance when he borrowed $205 million using his bitcoin as collateral — to buy more of the cryptocurrency.\"We have $5 billion in collateral. We borrowed $200 million. So I'm not telling people to go out and take a highly leveraged loan. What I am doing, I think, is doing my best to lead the way and to normalize the bitcoin-backed financing industry,\" said Saylor in April.\"As people realize they can borrow against something, then they realize they never have to sell it, and then they start to stretch their time horizon from — 'It's a 36-month speculation,' to — 'It's a 36-year holding.'\"watch nowVIDEO3:2703:27MicroStrategy discusses why bitcoin is 'interesting' to Big Tech investorsSquawk Box Asia] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO2:1302:13CoinFlex is in a spat with 'Bitcoin Jesus' over an alleged $47 million in debtSquawk Box EuropeEmbattled cryptocurrency exchange CoinFlex will probably not be able to let customers withdraw money again on Thursday as it originally planned, CEO Mark Lamb said on Wednesday.\"We will need more time. And it's unlikely that withdrawals will be re-enabled tomorrow,\" Lamb told CNBC.However, CoinFlex is in talks with several large funds interested in buying the $47 million in debt allegedly owed by investor Roger Ver, Lamb added.CoinFlex is the latest victim of the cryptocurrency price crash that has seen billions of dollars wiped off the market in the latest \"crypto winter.\" Bitcoin has lost more than 50% of its value this year, and is off about 70% from its all-time peak last November, while ether is down 70% this year and more than 75% from its peak.The cryptocurrency exchange paused withdrawals for customers last week citing \"extreme market conditions,\" and said an individual investor owed it around $47 million. Initially, CoinFlex did not name the customer, but on Tuesday, Lamb claimed the investor is Roger Ver, who has been dubbed \"Bitcoin Jesus\" for his evangelical views on cryptocurrency in the early days of the industry.Ver has denied that he owes CoinFlex the money. Ver was not immediately available for comment on this story when contacted by CNBC.Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it. This time the Fed's steering the shipApple may be seeing a demand split for iPhone 14 models, Bank of America saysMorgan Stanley says this EV battery maker can rally as much as 350%CoinFlex claimed that Ver's account went into \"negative equity.\" Normally, the exchange would liquidate an investor's position in this situation. But Ver had a particular agreement that meant this did not happen, the exchange said.To fix the $47 million hole in CoinFlex's balance sheet, the company is issuing a token called Recovery Value USD, or rvUSD, and enticing investors with a 20% interest rate for holding the virtual currency. Lamb said the ability to pay that interest rate would come from recouping the funds from Ver plus a \"financing charge\" that has been imposed on him.Lamb said \"we don't know what's going to happen after if he doesn't repay or if he does repay, our focus right now is on ... getting ... these funds raised.\"He added he is confident \"that one way of another, this recovery is going to happen.\"Lamb said that the company is talking to multiple funds that buy distressed debts of companies, and that could potentially buy the entire $47 million.\"The good news is that the number of players that have reached out that are interested in this debt offering and this token offering are extremely well capitalized,\" Lamb said, adding that some of the funds that have gotten in contact have more than $10 billion in assets under management.Lamb said that some of the inquiries have come from traditional funds rather than crypto-focused funds, but declined to name any of them.\"We're talking about tens of millions (of dollars). It's coming from a mixture of distressed debt funds, existing users of the platform, and investors in CoinFlex,\" Lamb told CNBC.Spat between CoinFlex and 'Bitcoin Jesus'The spat between Lamb and Ver marks the latest saga in the crypto market amid a slump in digital coin prices.Lamb said this week that Ver has been served with a notice of default. The CoinFlex CEO told CNBC that the goal is to \"continue to talk with him (Ver) and resolve this amicably.\" However, Lamb said there are other routes for legal recourse.\"We also have an obligation to go through the appropriate legal channels as well,\" he said.The agreement between CoinFlex and Ver meant that if the investor failed to meet a margin call, then his positions would not be automatically liquidated as would normally be the case.A margin call is a situation in which an investor must commit more funds to avoid losses on a trade made with borrowed cash.Lamb said that CoinFlex felt comfortable to go into such an agreement because of the \"data we'd seen around his capitalization.\"But CoinFlex will now be eliminating such agreements, Lamb said.\"In hindsight, having no non-liquidation agreements would have definitely been better,\" Lamb said.] \n",

Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY, introduced legislation on Tuesday to create a regulatory framework for the crypto markets. Because U.S. lawmakers effectively set policy and standards for the world, a draconian response in Washington, D.C., could have major repercussions across the globe.Beyond their use in trading and speculative investing, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen increased utility in recent months, as people from numerous different countries sent tens of millions of dollars to Ukraine via crypto payment rails to support the war effort and the defense against Russia.Meanwhile, Ukrainians fleeing the country were able to take their money with them in the form of cryptocurrency stored on a USB drive. A similar narrative played out in Afghanistan in August, when the Taliban took over the country and banks there closed down.\"Bitcoin provides financial inclusion and empowerment because it is open and permissionless,\" the latest letter said. \"We are not industry financiers or professional lobbyists but humanitarians and democracy advocates who have used bitcoin to assist people at risk when other options have failed.\"Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it. This time the Fed's steering the shipApple may be seeing a demand split for iPhone 14 models, Bank of America saysMorgan Stanley says this EV battery maker can rally as much as 350%The letter cites Nigeria, Turkey and Argentina as places where local currencies are no longer functioning properly and people need the relative stability of decentralized digital money for protection.Last week, a group of prominent technologists presented Congress with the opposite side of the story. They said that the world is witnessing a growing number of catastrophes \"related to blockchain technologies and crypto-asset investments,\" and described those events as \"the inevitable outcomes of a technology that is not built for purpose and will remain forever unsuitable as a foundation for large-scale economic activity.\"Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer for the Human Rights Foundation and one of the signatories of Tuesday's letter, noted that 23 of the 25 people who wrote the anti-crypto letter are from the U.S. or Europe, \"where they enjoy dollars and euros.\"Gladstein said that in reality, bitcoin and stablecoins are helping save people from true humanitarian catastrophes in places like Lebanon and Venezuela.\"One could almost excuse the 25 technologists who wrote the anti-crypto letter for not understanding the global impact of bitcoin,\" Gladstein said in an interview.One of the 25 crypto critics was Tim Bray, who previously worked as a senior engineer at Amazon. He told CNBC that crypto has two major problems: \"The technology isn't very good,\" and there's a proliferating \"culture of sleaze and rug pulls and NFTs and ponzis.\" NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital collectibles that have soared and crashed in value at various times over the past year.But Gladstein and his allies say that perspective comes from people in the West, who have never experienced \"the horrors of monetary colonialism, misogynist financial policy, frozen bank accounts, exploitative remittance companies, and an inability to connect to the global economy.\"\"If the Congress intends to restrict the ability of Americans to use bitcoin, it needs to know that this is going to have significant negative effects for the millions of people who rely on it worldwide,\" said Gladstein.WATCH: Sen.

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO5:4005:40Snoop Dogg: Crypto winter 'weeded out' the NFT abusersCrypto WorldPerhaps the most prominent celebrity figure in the Web3 zeitgeist is Snoop Dogg, but for Snoop being an early adopter is nothing new. In 2014, the rap icon was part of a $50 million investment into Reddit, which valued the company at around $500 million at the time. Today, the platform is worth $15 billion, according to PitchBook data. He's also known for private investments into fintech companies like Robinhood, Klarna and MoonPay, and for investments in the cannabis space. In 2015, just one year before weed was approved to be legalized for recreational use in California, Snoop co-founded Los Angeles-based Casa Verde Capital — a VC fund that has more than doubled in size.Of course, these days, anyone following him on Twitter knows that his attention has been consumed by anything and everything that has to do with Web3 ⁠— especially NFTs.NFTs are unique digital assets, like artwork and sports trading cards, that are verified and stored using blockchain technology, but critics see them as overhyped and potentially harmful to the environment given the energy-intensive nature of cryptocurrencies. Many NFTs are built on the network behind ethereum, the second-biggest token.watch nowVIDEO3:5603:56What are NFTs?CNBC ExplainsEarlier this year, Snoop announced his plans to turn Death Row Records, a record label that he acquired from Blackstone-controlled MNRK Music Group, into an \"NFT label.\" Shortly after, one of his first NFT collections called \"Journey of the Dogg\" saw one token sell at auction for over $100,000. In September, Snoop revealed that he had an alias known as anonymous NFT art collector Cozomo de' Medici, who had a digital collection worth over $17 million.\"I know [NFTs] have a great opportunity to be big in music, because sooner or later the labels are going to have to come on in,\" Snoop told CNBC in an exclusive interview at last week's NFT.NYC conference in New York City. \"They're going to have to come on home and sit at the table and understand that catalogs and things they hold onto are better served on the blockchain than sitting in the catalog collecting cobwebs.\"\"And it's not just labels,\" his son, Cordell Broadus, a.k.a. Champ Medici, added. \"It's movie studios, it's tech companies, it's beverage companies ... everybody's rushing to Web3 and they see how big Dogg is in the space.\"Playing in Snoop's SandboxSnoop has also spent the past year digging into the metaverse.He recently partnered with gaming platform The Sandbox to sell \"The Snoopverse Early Access Pass\" which gives buyers access to experiences in The Snoopverse, his own branded world within The Sandbox platform. There were 5,000 early access passes minted using blockchain technology at the time of its launch. Each one currently costs a bit more than $600, and according to The Sandbox, there are currently 1,114 owners, which means that the sale has generated nearly $700,000 — a significant haircut from the $1.7 million it had generated earlier in the year. The recent downturn has been dubbed by many as the latest \"crypto winter,\" referring to a period when crypto prices fall and stay low for an extended period of time.\"I feel like every great industry has a downfall,\" Snoop said. \"There's been a depression in every industry you can look at ... alcohol, tobacco, clothing, food; every industry you can imagine.\"Some crypto industry leaders expect a period of \"creative destruction\" wiping out many players. Mark Cuban, who has become a big investor in blockchain-based technologies, recently compared the crypto crash to \"the lull that the internet went through\" during the dotcom bubble and tweeted that there are too many imitators out there. Snoop Dogg has a similar view.\"This [crypto winter] weeded out all the people who weren't supposed to be in the space and who were abusing the opportunities that were there\" he said. \"Now it's going to bring on great business, and moving forward, when the market comes back, there will only be great things to pick and choose from,\" he added.Snoop's latest project is a collaboration with Food Fighters Universe (FFU), which claims to be the world's first NFT restaurant group. His ice cream brand, Dr. Bombay's Sweet Exploration, is set to open in Los Angeles under the FFU umbrella. The brand was inspired by an NFT that Snoop owns from the prominent Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, many of which skyrocketed in price and became the most recognizable NFTs online, but have seen steep declines in price during the recent digital currencies selloff. ApeCoin, a token launched by Bored Ape creators Yuga Labs, has seen a steep increase since Snoop appeared on-stage at NFT.NYC on Thursday night to debut a new single with Eminem, featuring the Bored Ape branding in the rap duo's corresponding music video.As is the case with many NFT collections, FFU token holders have exclusive access to various festivals, benefits and perks via their ownership of one of the 10,000 NFTs in the collection. Additionally, all physical restaurant locations that fall under the FFU umbrella will accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.FFU co-founder Kevin Seo told CNBC it will launch \"within this year\" and will be a dessert retail experience built around the Snoop Dogg community. Separately, Champ Medici's Bored Taco will continue to be a food truck and a ghost kitchen brand. \"We're excited to continue to create ways to utilize crypto as payment and showcase utility through our Food Fighters Universe NFTs, with access to events and free food with our NFT holders,\" Seo said.\"Web3 and NFTs? This is just the beginning,\" Champ told CNBC. \"People are going to look back at this five years from now and see how innovative Food Fighters Universe was and how we were pushing the boundaries very early when other people didn't see the vision.\"While prominent investors continue to be believers in the long-term potential of digital assets, including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, there are plenty of skeptics.Speaking at a TechCrunch talk on climate change last week, Bill Gates described the crypto and NFT phenomenon as something that's \"100% based on greater fool theory,\" referring to the idea that overvalued assets will go up in price when there are enough investors willing to pay more for them.The billionaire Microsoft co-founder joked that \"expensive digital images of monkeys\" would \"improve the world immensely,\" referring to the much-hyped Bored Apes.Meanwhile, crypto investors continue to grapple with aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and a worsening liquidity crunch that has pushed major players into financial difficulty and given a megaphone to some of the biggest NFT skeptics. The broader space is also still reeling from the fallout of the $60 billion collapse of two major tokens last month.watch nowVIDEO8:0608:06Crypto fund defaults on $670M loan, and Bitfury CEO says prices aren't 'relevant': CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO3:5503:55Crypto industry pours $30 million into campaigns amid growing lobbying influenceTechCheckU.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., called on New Yorkers to support the cryptocurrency market in a March op-ed in the New York Daily News titled, \"A liberal case for cryptocurrency.\"\"With a multi-billion dollar market capitalization, crypto is here to stay. It's not going anywhere. New York City should and must embrace crypto if it is to remain the financial capital of the world,\" wrote Torres, who sits on the House Financial Services Committee.Torres failed to mention two upcoming fundraisers industry backers were throwing for him in April. Crypto investors Ben Horowitz, Anthony Albanese and Chris Dixon — leaders at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — hosted the \"Ritchie Torres Ethereum Fundraiser\" at the swanky private nightclub Zero Bond in New York City on April 13, according to invitations viewed by CNBC. One of the invites promised \"cocktails and conversation\" with Torres, asking donors to contribute between $500 and $5,800 to attend the event. Another invite suggested donors contribute in ether, a type of cryptocurrency that's trading at around $2,000.Jtsorrell | Istock | Getty ImagesHorowitz, Albanes and Dixon did not respond to requests for comment. An aide to Torres confirmed details of the fundraiser.Torres' op-ed and his ongoing support in Congress point to the crypto industry's growing influence in Washington, D.C. Not only has the industry hired more than 200 officials and staff from the White House, Congress, Federal Reserve and political campaigns, according to the Tech Transparency Project, crypto executives have contributed more than $30 million toward federal candidates and campaigns since the start of the 2020 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. Those investments have begun paying dividends as crypto executives landed hearings on Capitol Hill and helped to secure backing for amendments to President Joe Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill, congressional aides say.Money and influenceCrypto investors have established at least two new political action committees just this year, seeded with tens of millions of dollars, aimed at helping industry-friendly lawmakers get elected to Congress. Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of crypto exchange FTX, is the primary force behind the political action committee Protect Our Future, which has raised more than $14 million and could tip the scales in House races in Ohio and Oregon.The PAC has already endorsed Torres, who told NBC News last month that he's received \"minimal\" campaign contributions from the industry.Fred Wilson, a partner at venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, which is also heavily invested in cryptocurrencies, co-hosted another fundraising event for Torres in April, the lawmaker's aide confirmed. The aide, who asked not to be named because the events were private, noted that the Wilson fundraiser had been rescheduled to April after originally being set to take place in December.Bankman-Fried; SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci, who was Trump's short-lived communications director; and brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens, co-founders of Blockchain Capital, have donated more than $20 million combined in the 2022 election cycle so far, according to FEC records. Bankman-Fried, for instance, contributed $5 million toward pro-Biden super PAC Future Forward during the president's successful 2020 run for the White House.Members of the group of crypto financiers also launched and financed GMI PAC this cycle, with aims to spend $20 million to boost congressional candidates. Ryan Salame, co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, a subsidiary of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, joined as one the super PAC's early backers, along with CMS Holdings co-founder Dan Matuszewski. SkyBridge Capital was one of the original backers of the committee.Bankman-Fried donated $2 million to the super PAC in January.'Minimal' contributionsTorres defended his crypto-backed events in a statement to CNBC, reiterating that he's received \"minimal\" contributions from those in the digital currency industry.\"During the 2020 and 2022 election cycles, I have raised well over $5 million, of which crypto represents a mere 1%— hence the term 'minimal,'\" Torres said in the statement. \"Having said all that, there's nothing shocking about individuals supporting candidates who share their policy views. That is what voters and donors typically do.\"Salame has emerged as a major campaign booster, courting lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. He launched the American Dream Federal Action PAC in April with $4 million in seed money, according to Politico. It supports \"forward-looking\" Republicans \"who want to protect America's long term economic and national security by advancing smart policy decisions now,\" according to the website and FEC filings.Bankman-Fried, who declined to comment through FTX's spokesman Peter Padovano, testified Thursday before the House Agriculture Committee at a hearing titled, \"Changing Market Roles: The FTX Proposal and Trends in New Clearinghouse Models.\" Scaramucci and the Stephens brothers did not respond to requests for comment. Padovano did not respond to emails requesting to speak to Salame.'I love FTX'Salame donated $500,000 in April to a super PAC closely aligned with Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the powerful Senate Banking Committee, FEC records show.Tillis privately told allies \"I love FTX\" after he saw the donation pop up in FEC records earlier this month, according to people who overheard the remarks. They asked not to be identified because the conversation was private.Daniel Keylin, a senior advisor to Tillis, told CNBC in an email that his boss has \"voiced some concerns with the crypto industry and the need for Congress to focus on right-sizing regulations that focus on consumer protections while allowing the industry to continue innovating.\"Bankman-Fried told members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition in an April meeting that the industry would back some regulation, but it's concerned about how some proposals will affect the larger crypto business.Clarity\"His message has been kind of consistent with what we've heard from a lot of different industry players which is, 'we need some clarity. We're not opposing regulation. We want regulation. We want investor protection regulation. We want some clarity,'\" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and was at the meeting, told CNBC in an interview.For all its growing influence, the industry was unsuccessful in getting the Biden administration to drop a provision in its $1 trillion infrastructure law that requires crypto brokers to notify the IRS through a 1099 form of crypto transactions.\"Crypto folks started to freak out,\" and began flooding lawmakers' offices to get that provision altered after the details became public last year, according to one congressional aide.Executives, however, seem to have been successful in convincing a bipartisan group of senators to spearhead efforts in Congress that could have impacted the measure.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore. and Senate Banking Committee ranking Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania originally co-sponsored a crypto-related amendment. Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Mark Warner, D-Va.; and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. also signed on to crypto-tied amendments. The White House backed the Warner, Portman, and Sinema amendment.Lummis is also a industry investor; she owns between $100,001 and $250,000 in bitcoin holdings, according to her latest annual financial disclosure report.One provision would have excluded miners and software developers from new tax requirements imposed on crypto brokers. The other would have specifically exempted cryptocurrency miners, who participate in \"proof of work\" systems such as bitcoin and ether, from within the bill's tax provisions.The amendments never made it into the final bill that was later signed by Biden.Dorsey gives thanksStill, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who also founded digital payments company Block, thanked the lawmakers for their efforts. Dorsey gave his own suggestions to the lawmakers through a string of tweets that also suggested how the legislation should be written.\"To @RonWyden, @SenLummis, @SenToomey, @MarkWarner, @SenRobPortman, @SenatorSinema, @TedCruz, respective staff & everyone who's worked on the Infrastructure Bill 'Crypto Tax Reporting' provision: thank you for your work to get this right. May we offer a workable simplification?\" Dorsey tweeted.Wyden said in a statement to CNBC that civil liberties groups, tech experts and \"folks in Oregon\" raised concerns that the provision could inadvertently regulate independent software developers.\"After studying the issue, I came to the judgement that a simple clarification of the language would give the tech community the certainty they needed, while still regulating brokers to ensure nobody can use crypto to avoid paying the taxes they owe,\" he said.A representative for Toomey declined to comment. Representatives for Lummis, Warner, Portman and Sinema did not return requests for comment.'Running wild'\"There's a general awareness that the crypto market, unregulated, running wild, doing financial transactions can be a mechanism to scam, as well as to be used by criminal organizations,\" Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., said in an interview. The industry is lobbying against a bill he co-sponsored that would subject crypto trading platforms to similar regulations as federally insured banks — in an effort to clamp down on Russians using digital currencies to evade Western sanctions.The industry has at least one thing going in its favor: It can take years, even decades, for Congress to debate and adopt new rules regulating complex market issues.House lawmakers need time to understand the intricacies of the crypto industry, Himes said. So there's little chance Congress will pass legislation that reins in the industry — at least not in this congressional session, he said.\"I've told people we're not at a point where I think we're going to start passing legislation just because we're not kind of at a point where there's a critical mass of educated members,\" Himes said. \"I don't think in this Congress we're going to pass legislation,\" he added, referring to crypto specific bills.Congress, however, may be the least of the industry's worries.Crypto collapseThe Biden administration appears to be taking the lead in the pushback against crypto. The president signed an executive order earlier this year calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies.The Securities and Exchange Commission announced earlier this month that it's nearly doubling its staff responsible for protecting investors in cryptocurrency markets. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for increased regulation to reduce the risk of fraud or illicit transactions.Yellen told lawmakers Thursday that last week's cryptocurrency sell-off that erased more than $200 billion from the crypto market illustrated the need for federal regulation.\"This is among the most painful weeks in crypto history & one we'll reckon with for a long time to come,\" Jake Chervinsky, the head of policy at the crypto lobbying group Blockchain Association, tweeted Friday.He then encouraged policymakers that the best way to handle stablecoins is to \"follow the process called for by the [executive order], develop a bipartisan consensus in Congress, adopt new regulations that are fit for purpose.\"A run on the Terra stablecoin, caused it to drop in value from roughly $8 to below 30 cents. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a specific value, usually the dollar, another currency or gold. Its parity with the dollar is what, in theory, makes it stable. However, volatility in the cryptocurrency market last week challenged that premise.\"We've had a real life demonstration of the risks,\" Yellen said, referring to the meltdown of the TerraUSD beginning last Monday.\"We really need a regulatory framework to guard against the risks,\" Yellen said. \"Really, we need a comprehensive framework so that there are no gaps in the regulation.\"] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [The logo of cryptocurrency platform Solana.Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto via | Getty ImagesSolana, one of the largest cryptocurrencies after bitcoin and ether, fell more than 12% on Wednesday as its blockchain suffered its second outage in the last month.Validators in the network were not processing new blocks for several hours. Applications built on Solana's blockchain were taken offline as a result.The Twitter account Solana Status flagged the incident at about 1 P.M. eastern. To fix this latest outage, validators had to restart, following instructions linked to from this same Twitter account, which later said the outage lasted four and a half hours.In recent years, Solana has been gaining traction in the NFT and DeFi ecosystems because it's cheaper and faster to use than ethereum. Its blockchain processes 50,000 transactions per second, and its average cost per transaction is $0.00025, according to its website. Ethereum can only handle roughly 13 transactions per second and transaction fees are substantially more expensive than on Solana. Investors who had been focused largely on ethereum began diversifying into Solana and other alternative blockchains during last year's crypto run-up, and Solana closed a $314 million private token sale led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital in June 2021.But the last year and a half has laid bare the trade-off as the blockchain network has suffered multiple outages. Most recently, on May 1, Solana locked up for several hours before it was similarly brought back online following a restart of its validator network.watch nowVIDEO15:3615:36Why Anatoly Yakovenko left traditional tech to co-found SolanaCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO5:2605:26How Terra's stablecoin collapsed and sent shockwaves through crypto marketsCrypto WorldThis week, backers of the failed cryptocurrency project Terra voted to revive the initiative, with a new luna blockchain and token – and without its controversial algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD.The founders had been seeking the next step forward for the project that crashed as quickly as it took off. The collapse of the Terra project led to combined losses of about $60 billion between the stablecoin, also known as UST, and its sister cryptocurrency luna. Earlier this month, UST plummeted below its $1 peg, which incited a cryptocurrency sell-off.Like many stablecoins, UST was pegged at a 1-to-1 ratio with the dollar. Minting one new UST required \"burning,\" or destroying, one luna. This structure allowed for arbitrage opportunities that were key to maintaining the peg: Users could always swap one luna for UST and vice versa at a guaranteed price of $1, regardless of the market price of either token at the time.\"What the Luna ecosystem did was they had a very aggressive and optimistic monetary policy that pretty much worked when markets were going very well, but they had a very weak monetary policy for when we encounter bear markets,\" said Stuti Pandey, a Web3 investor and venture partner at Farmer Fund.Tether previously claimed its stablecoin was backed 1-to-1 by U.S. dollars.Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesThis isn't the first time a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin failed. Many in crypto had hoped the Terra project might succeed. But it may be a long time before investors recover from this month's Terra fiasco —and that could put the new project on shaky ground.\"There's a big question mark. Whether that will be successful will take a lot of rebuilding trust with investors and builders,\" Felix Hartmann, managing partner of Hartmann Capital, told CNBC.\"It will also take a lot of unthankful grind on the part of the founders of luna because they will no longer have the billion-dollar market caps that they had before: They will likely start at the ground floor again,\" he added. \"So it's something worth watching, but perhaps the real fruition — if it ever happens — would be over a year or two. Certainly not this month.\"Regulatory hurdles also loom. Stablecoins have been top of mind for regulators for the same exact reasons highlighted by the TerraUSD crash: lack of transparency in the trading of stablecoins and the reserves backing them, as well as market participants' reliance on them to enable trading in other crypto protocols..\"Algorithmic stablecoins as an idea are dead,\" said Omid Malekan, a crypto industry veteran and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School.\"There are other ones out there not as big as UST and they're all in some state of failure to maintain the peg right now,\" he added. \"That failure has sort of made the other more conservative stablecoins — the fiat-backed ones — seem very appealing in comparison. But the open question now is also what kind of a regulatory response the entire industry gets.\"—CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this story.] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO0:3300:33Woman behind $4B crypto fraud scheme makes FBI's ten most wanted fugitive listThe News with Shepard SmithWASHINGTON — The FBI on Thursday added Dr. Ruja Ignatova, the self-proclaimed 'Cryptoqueen,' to its list of Ten Most Wanted fugitives, and is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.Ignatova, the founder of a cryptocurrency called OneCoin that was launched in 2014, allegedly defrauded investors of more than $4 billion over three years, before disappearing. Europol added her to Europe's most wanted list last month.Investigators say the Bulgarian-based project had no blockchain securing transactions and coins were essentially minted out of thin air. Bitcoin, by contrast, is secured by a global network of miners who maintain a public ledger, or blockchain.The Southern District of New York held a press conference on Thursday morning to announce the addition of Ignatova to its top fugitives list.Mike Driscoll, the FBI's assistant director in charge of the New York office said that he was \"confident\" they would find her eventually. and Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, called Ignatova \"an international fugitive who allegedly masterminded a worldwide fraud.\"Williams also noted that Ignatova now \"sits side by side on the Top Ten list with cartel leaders, murderers, and terrorists.\"Ignatova has been in the criminal justice system for at least a half-decade. She was indicted by a federal grand jury in October 2017, and the Southern District of New York subsequently issued an arrest warrant.In February 2018, a superseding indictment was issued, charging Ignatova with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud. Each count carries a sentence of up to 20 years.  As for Ignatova's whereabouts, the FBI noted in a press release that the OneCoin founder traveled from Bulgaria to Greece on Oct. 25, 2017, though she could have continued on from there.\"She may travel on a German passport to the United Arab Emirates, Bulgaria, Germany, Russia, Greece and/or Eastern Europe,\" the FBI said.Ignatov's brother, Konstantin, who also served in a leadership role with OneCoin, was arrested in 2019 and subsequently pleaded guilty to multiple felonies that same year.Investigators describe the large-scale fraud as similar to an international pyramid scheme. Ignatova allegedly made false statements to solicit investments. Victims would then send cash to OneCoin accounts in order to buy the coin.In 2019, the FBI's then Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney Jr. said OneCoin \"offered investors no method of tracing their money, and it could not be used to purchase anything. In fact, the only ones who stood to benefit from its existence were its founders and co-conspirators.\"At the height of OneCoin's popularity in 2016, Ignatova took the stage at England's Wembley Arena in a ballgown to tout a coin that she said would eclipse bitcoin. Igantova was also known for throwing lavish parties in cities around the world.The FBI asks that anyone with information about her whereabouts contact the bureau at tips.fbi.gov.WATCH: Bitwise's Matt Hougan on what crypto investors should watchwatch nowVIDEO5:5405:54Bitwise's Matt Hougan breaks down what crypto investors should watch after Three Arrows defaultCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [The crypto market can be volatile, but it's still attractive to young people who have \"higher risk appetites,\" said Chris Adam of SharpRank.Insta_photos | Istock | Getty ImagesMore than 46,000 people say they lost over $1 billion in crypto to scams since the start of 2021, according to a report released by the Federal Trade Commission on Friday.Losses last year were nearly 60 times what they were in 2018, with a median individual loss of $2,600.The FTC notes that the top cryptocurrencies people said they used to pay scammers were bitcoin (70%), tether (10%), and ether (9%).One key feature of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is that payment transfers are final and can't be reversed. This isn't always a good thing. Chargebacks — a type of tool designed to protect consumers — allow consumers to reverse a transaction if they claim they have been fraudulently charged for a good or service they did not receive.Nearly half the people who reported losing crypto to a scam since 2021 said it started with some kind of message on a social media platform. The top platforms mentioned in these complaints were Instagram (32%), Facebook (26%), WhatsApp (9%), and Telegram (7%).watch nowVIDEO9:1909:19Crypto prices could fall another 30%, says Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurgCrypto WorldFake investment opportunities were by far the most common type of scam. In 2021, $575 million of crypto fraud losses reported to the FTC related to investment opportunities. People reported that investment websites and apps would let them track the growth of their crypto, but the apps were fake, and when they tried to get their money out they could not.\"There's no bank or other centralized authority to flag suspicious transactions and attempt to stop fraud before it happens,\" the FTC warns in its report. \"These considerations are not unique to crypto transactions, but they all play into the hands of scammers.\"Romance scams are the second-most common source of crypto fraud losses, followed by business and government impersonation scams, which the FTC said can often start with fake messages purporting to be from tech companies like Amazon or Microsoft.Younger consumers were more likely to be taken in by crypto scams. The FTC reports that people aged 20 to 49 were more than three times as likely as older age groups to report losing crypto to a scammer.To avoid being scammed, the FTC says, people should understand that cryptocurrency investments never have guaranteed returns, avoid business arrangements that require a crypto purchase, and watch out for romantic come-ons accompanied by a crypto solicitation.The news comes after a tumultuous few weeks in the crypto markets. A failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin helped drag down the entire crypto asset class, erasing half a trillion dollars from the sector's market cap and denting investor confidence in the process. Many institutional and retail investors got wiped out, and for the most part, there are no backstops from the FDIC, nor any other consumer insurance protections.Billionaire bitcoiners Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss recently announced layoffs at crypto exchange Gemini, citing the fact that the industry is in a \"contraction phase\" known as \"crypto winter,\" which has been \"further compounded by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil.\"watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

Leading up to the overhaul, investors have been jumping into ether, the native token to ethereum.In the past three months, ether has jumped 32%, dramatically outperforming bitcoin, which has dropped 9%. While analysts say that anticipation around the merge has helped pump up the price, some experts see the real upside coming after the merge takes place.\"We believe post-merge the bull case for ethereum is going to be a lot stronger for a number of reasons,\" said Katie Talati, head of research at asset management firm Arca. The main factor, she says, is that supply is going to come way down, creating scarcity.The hallmark of ethereum's big makeover is that it will take a lot less energy to verify transactions, which has long been a major problem for the crypto industry. The proof-of-stake model, which is replacing the proof-of-work model, requires validators on the network to put up their ether tokens, or \"stake\" them, essentially pulling them out of circulation for an extended period of time, in order to secure the network.\"For probably six to 12 months — there's no defined guidance yet from developers on ethereum — you will not be able to withdraw your ethereum once you've staked it to validate the network,\" Talati said.watch nowVIDEO6:4706:47Two crypto experts say the Ethereum network merge is criticalWorldwide ExchangeSlashing energy consumption by more than 99% will also go a long way toward lowering the barrier to entry for institutional investors, who have been battling the optics of contributing to the climate crisis. The White House last week released a report warning that proof-of-work mining operations could get in the way of efforts to mitigate climate change.Still, some skepticism has been creeping into the market.Ether is down around 6% in the last 24 hours following the latest official read on inflation in the U.S., which punished risky assets on Tuesday and drove tech stocks to their worst day in over two years.Whether to buy now or wait and see how the merge goes depends on an investor's time horizon for holding the coins, said Jaydeep Korde, CEO of ethereum infrastructure builder Launchnodes. Korde tells CNBC that traders who plan to sit on their stake for the long term — in the range of two to three years — should be in good shape.\"If you're looking in the shorter-term horizon in terms of trading, I think that it's much more volatile,\" Korde said. He cited global economic conditions, geopolitics and inflation as playing into the immediate risk.\"Ethereum will suffer the challenges of that volatility, like every other asset class,\" Korde said.watch nowVIDEO4:0804:08Here's a reality check on some of the hype surrounding Ethereum's MergeCrypto WorldJuicing institutional interestWith the upgrade, ethereum won't become faster, cheaper or more scalable. One developer even told CNBC that if the user experience feels the same, that will be one sign that the merge was a total success.The real investor draw is the slashing of energy usage, especially as bitcoin mining continues to face blowback for its growing power consumption.Since its creation almost a decade ago, ether has — similar to bitcoin — been mined through a proof-of-work model. It involves complex math equations that massive numbers of machines race to solve, and it uses an abundance of energy. The new proof-of-stake method requires users to leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and secure the network.Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it. This time the Fed's steering the shipApple may be seeing a demand split for iPhone 14 models, Bank of America saysMorgan Stanley says this EV battery maker can rally as much as 350%According to one estimate on the Ethereum Foundation's blog, the merge will result in a reduction of at least 99.95% in total energy use.Bank of America said in a note on Sept. 9, that the significant reduction in energy consumption post-merge \"may enable some institutional investors to purchase the token that were previously prohibited from purchasing tokens that run on blockchains leveraging proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanisms.\"Institutional money is key to the maturation of digital assets. Research firm Fundstrat wrote in a note that a successful merge would cement ethereum as the \"premier blockchain network.\"Ethereum has set itself apart from rival chains, as more of an operating system for the industry. The vast majority of apps are built on top of ethereum, and the merge is the first in a series of planned upgrades that should ultimately result in faster and cheaper transactions.The reduced supply of the cryptocurrency, which some investors say could be a boon to the price, is the result of a new verification model that replaces miners with \"validators.\"The rewards for validators are much smaller than those that went to proof-of-work miners, meaning that less ether will be minted as a result of this upgrade.Additionally, as part of an upgrade that went into effect last August, the network is already \"burning,\" or permanently destroying, a portion of the digital currency that would otherwise be recycled back into circulation.Talati says that people may look back in three to six months and say, \"That was the inflection point and the turning point for ethereum.\"The bitcoin network experiences a similar type of supply reduction roughly every four years.Bitcoin's production declines exponentially over time, thanks to something called \"the halvening\" or \"the halving,\" when the size of the prize for miners is cut in half. The halving was built into bitcoin's code by its pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, as a way to stave off inflation of the cryptocurrency.watch nowVIDEO11:3711:37Can ethereum topple bitcoin as the crypto king?Crypto\"Bitcoin can't issue any more shares,\" Fundstrat's Tom Lee previously told CNBC. \"It doesn't do stock splits or dividends, so the only way to increase the network value of bitcoin is for the unit price to go up.\"There have been three halvings of bitcoin, to date. The last one, in May 2020, preceded a steep rally that continued through late 2021, before the crypto \"winter\" began.For ether, the website for Ultrasound Money has simulated the forthcoming supply changes. In its model, the annual issuance drops from 5.5 million tokens to 600,000 and estimates that the supply growth drops to 0.1% from 4.1%.Regardless of the changing dynamics that come with the merge, the crypto market is likely to still be driven in part by a hefty dose of pure speculation and events that have nothing to do with the fundamentals of the tokens or blockchain networks.The steep selloff this year — ether is down 56% even after the recent rally — is tied to rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve's effort to tamp down inflation.Investors have been rotating out of risky assets, even those that are supposed to act as a hedge against inflation, so the merge may not immediately change investor sentiment.WATCH: Bitcoin falls below $19,000 as Ethereum upgrade kicks into full gearwatch nowVIDEO4:5604:56Bitcoin falls below $19,000 as Ethereum upgrade kicks into full gearWorldwide Exchange] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO7:0107:01Galaxy Digital's head of mining on what a proof-of-work moratorium would mean for New York StateCrypto WorldFollowing an early morning vote in Albany on Friday, lawmakers in New York passed a bill to ban certain bitcoin mining operations that run on carbon-based power sources. The measure now heads to the desk of Governor Kathy Hochul, who could sign it into law or veto it.If Hochul signs the bill, it would make New York the first state in the country to ban blockchain technology infrastructure, according to Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. Industry insiders also tell CNBC it could have a domino effect across the U.S., which is currently at the forefront of the global bitcoin mining industry, accounting for 38% of the world's miners.The New York bill, which previously passed the State Assembly in late April before heading to the State Senate, calls for a two-year moratorium on certain cryptocurrency mining operations which use proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions. Proof-of-work mining, which requires sophisticated gear and a whole lot of electricity, is used to create bitcoin. Ethereum is switching to a less energy-intensive process, but will still use this method for at least for another few months.The push for an eleventh-hour vote came as leadership in the state capitol managed to flip some of the senators who were previously undecided.Lawmakers backing the legislation say they are looking to curb the state's carbon footprint by cracking down on mines that use electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels. If it passes — for two years, unless a proof-of-work mining company uses 100% renewable energy, it would not be allowed to expand or renew permits, and new entrants would not be allowed to come online.The net effect of this, according to Boring, would be to weaken New York's economy by forcing businesses to take jobs elsewhere.\"This is a significant setback for the state and will stifle its future as a leader in technology and global financial services. More importantly, this decision will eliminate critical union jobs and further disenfranchise financial access to the many underbanked populations living in the Empire State,\" Boring tells CNBC.It is a sentiment echoed by Galaxy Digital's Amando Fabiano, who says that \"New York is setting a bad precedent that other states could follow.\"As for timing, the law would go into effect as soon as the governor signs off.watch nowVIDEO7:0607:06Chamber of Digital Commerce explains effects of Terra turmoil on consumer protectionCrypto WorldThe irony of banning bitcoin miningOne section of the bill involves conducting a statewide study of the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining operations on New York's ability to reach aggressive climate goals set under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires New York's greenhouse gas emissions be cut by 85% by 2050.Boring tells CNBC the recent swell of support in favor of this year's proposed ban has a whole lot to do with this mandate to transition to sustainable energy.\"Proof-of-work mining has the potential to lead the global transition to more sustainable energy,\" Boring told CNBC's Crypto World, pointing to the irony of the moratorium. \"The bitcoin mining industry is actually leading in terms of compliance with that Act.\"The sustainable energy mix of the global bitcoin mining industry today is estimated to be just under 60%, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce has found that the sustainable electricity mix is closer to 80% for its members mining in the state of New York.\"The regulatory environment in New York will not only halt their target – carbon-based fuel proof of work mining – but will also likely discourage new, renewable-based miners from doing business with the state due to the possibility of more regulatory creep,\" said John Warren, CEO of institutional-grade bitcoin mining company GEM Mining.A third of New York's in-state generation comes from renewables, according to the latest available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. New York counts its nuclear power plants toward its 100% carbon free electricity goal, and the state produces more hydroelectric power than any other state east of the Rocky Mountains.The state also has a chilly climate, which means less energy is needed to cool down the banks of computers used in crypto mining, as well as a lot of abandoned industrial infrastructure that's ripe for repurposing. In a conversation at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami in April, former presidential candidate and New Yorker Andrew Yang told CNBC that when he speaks to folks in the industry, he has found mining operations can help develop demand for a renewable source of energy.\"In my mind, a lot of this stuff is going to end up pushing activity to other places that might not achieve the goal of the policymakers,\" said Yang.Some in the industry aren't waiting for the state to make a ban official before taking action.Data from digital currency company Foundry shows that New York's share of the bitcoin mining network dropped from 20% to 10% in a matter of months, as miners began migrating to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions in other parts of the country.\"Our customers are being scared off from investing in New York state,\" said Kevin Zhang of Foundry.\"Even from Foundry's deployments of $500 million in capital towards mining equipment, less than 5% has gone to New York because of the unfriendly political landscape,\" continued Zhang.watch nowVIDEO11:4311:43Andrew Yang explains how crypto and a universal basic income could intersectCrypto WorldThe domino effectIf the crypto mining moratorium is signed into law by the governor, it could have a number of follow-on effects.Beyond potentially stifling investment in more sustainable energy sources, industry advocates tell CNBC that each of these facilities drives significant economic impact with many local vendors consisting of electricians, engineers, and construction workers. An exodus of crypto miners, according to experts, could translate to jobs and tax dollars moving out of state.\"There are many labor unions who are against this bill because it could have dire economic consequences,\" said Boring. \"Bitcoin mining operations are providing high-paying and high-grade, great jobs for local communities. One of our members, their average pay is $80,000 a year.\"As Boring points out, New York is a leader when it comes to state legislation, so there is also the potential for a copycat phenomenon rippling across the country.\"Other blue states often follow the lead of New York state and this would be giving them an easy template to replicate,\" said Zhang, Foundry's SVP of Mining Strategy.\"Sure, the network will be fine — it survived a nation-state attack from China last summer — but the implications for where the technology will scale and develop in the future are massive,\" continued Zhang.However, many others in the industry think concerns over the fallout of a mining moratorium in New York are overblown.Veteran bitcoin miners like Core Scientific co-founder Darin Feinstein say the industry already knows New York is generally hostile to the crypto mining business.\"There's no reason to go into a region that doesn't want you,\" said Feinstein. \"Bitcoin miners are really a data center business, and the data center needs to locate in jurisdictions that want to have data centers within their borders...If you're going to ignore that, then you have to deal with the consequences of conducting business in a region that doesn't want your business.\"Feinstein and other miners point out that there are plenty of friendlier jurisdictions: Georgia, North Carolina, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming have all become major mining destinations.Texas, for example, has crypto-friendly lawmakers, a deregulated power grid with real-time spot pricing, and access to significant excess renewable energy, as well as stranded or flared natural gas. The state's regulatory friendliness toward miners also makes the industry very predictable, according to Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners.\"It is a very attractive environment for miners to deploy large amounts of capital in,\" he said. \"The sheer number of land deals and power purchase agreements that are in various stages of negotiation is enormous.\"A countrywide mandate on miningMeanwhile, the Biden Administration is formulating its own policy targeting bitcoin mining — with an aim to mitigate energy consumption and emissions.The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is examining the connections between distributed ledger technology and energy transitions, the potential for these technologies to impede or advance efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad, and the impacts these technologies have on the environment, according to Dr. Costa Samaras, who is the principal assistant director for energy.The effort is one of the deliverables spelled out in the president's executive order that was issued in March.Samaras tells CNBC that the White House is specifically examining the role these technologies might play in accounting for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as potentially supporting the buildout of a clean electricity grid.They're also \"taking a look at the implications for energy policy, including how cryptocurrencies can affect grid management and reliability.\"It is unclear whether these recommendations, which are due in September, will culminate in federal law on proof-of-work mining. For now, states are calling the shots.watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

Now, both are bankrupt, as a crash in token prices — coupled with an erosion of liquidity following a series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve — exposed these and other projects promising unsustainable yields.\"$3 trillion of liquidity will likely be taken out of markets globally by central banks over the next 18 months,\" said Alkesh Shah, a global crypto and digital asset strategist at Bank of America.But the washout of easy money is being welcomed by some of the world's top blockchain developers who say that leverage is a drug attracting people looking to make a quick buck — and it takes a system failure of this magnitude to clear out the bad actors.\"If there's something to learn from this implosion, it is that you should be very wary of people who are very arrogant,\" Eylon Aviv told CNBC from the sidelines of EthCC, an annual conference that draws developers and cryptographers to Paris for a week.\"This is one of the common denominators between all of them. It is sort of like a God complex — 'I'm going to build the best thing, I'm going to be amazing, and I just became a billionaire,'\" continued Aviv, who is a principal at Collider Ventures, an early-stage venture capital blockchain and crypto fund based in Tel Aviv.Much of the turmoil we've seen grip crypto markets since May can be traced back to these multibillion-dollar crypto companies with centralized figureheads who call the shots.\"The liquidity crunch affected DeFi yields, but it was a few irresponsible central actors that exacerbated this,\" said Walter Teng, a Digital Asset Strategy Associate at Fundstrat Global Advisors.The death of easy moneyBack when the Fed's benchmark rate was virtually zero and government bonds and savings accounts were paying out nominal returns, a lot of people turned to crypto lending platforms instead.During the boom in digital asset prices, retail investors were able to earn outlandish returns by parking their tokens on now defunct platforms like Celsius and Voyager Digital, as well as Anchor, which was the flagship lending product of a since failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project called TerraUSD that offered up to 20% annual percentage yields.The system worked when crypto prices were at record highs, and it was virtually free to borrow cash.But as research firm Bernstein noted in a recent report, the crypto market, like other risk-on assets, is tightly correlated to Fed policy. And indeed in the last few months, bitcoin along with other major cap tokens have been falling in tandem with these Fed rate hikes.In an effort to contain spiraling inflation, the Fed hiked its benchmark rate by another 0.75% on Wednesday, taking the funds rate to its highest level in nearly four years.Technologists gathered in Paris tell CNBC that sucking out the liquidity that's been sloshing around the system for years means an end to the days of cheap money in crypto.\"We expect greater regulatory protections and required disclosures supporting yields over the next six to twelve months, likely reducing the current high DeFi yields,\" said Shah.Some platforms put client funds into other platforms that similarly offered unrealistic returns, in a sort of dangerous arrangement wherein one break would upend the entire chain. One report drawing on blockchain analytics found that Celsius had at least half a billion dollars invested in the Anchor protocol which offered up to 20% APY to customers.\"The domino effect is just like interbank risk,\" explained Nik Bhatia, professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California. \"If credit has been extended that isn't properly collateralized or reserved against, failure will beget failure.\"Celsius, which had $25 billion in assets under management less than a year ago, is also being accused of operating a Ponzi scheme by paying early depositors with the money it got from new users.Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwardsCeFi versus DeFiSo far, the fallout in the crypto market has been contained to a very specific corner of the ecosystem known as centralized finance, or CeFi, which is different to decentralized finance, or DeFi.Though decentralization exists along a spectrum and there is no binary designation separating CeFi from DeFi platforms, there are a few hallmark features which help to place platforms into one of the two camps. CeFi lenders typically adopt a top-down approach wherein a few powerful voices dictate financial flows and how various parts of a platform work, and often operate in a sort of \"black box\" where borrowers don't really know how the platform functions. In contrast, DeFi platforms cut out middlemen like lawyers and banks and rely upon code for enforcement. A big part of the problem with CeFi crypto lenders was a lack of collateral to backstop loans. In Celsius' bankruptcy filing, for example, it shows that the company had more than 100,000 creditors, some of whom lent the platform cash without receiving the rights to any collateral to back up the arrangement.Without real cash behind these loans, the entire arrangement depended upon trust — and the continued flow of easy money to keep it all afloat.In DeFi, however, borrowers put in more than 100% collateral to backstop the loan. Platforms require this because DeFi is anonymous: Lenders don't know the borrower's name or credit score, nor do they have any other real-world metadata about their cash flow or capital upon which to base their decision to extend a loan. Instead, the only thing that matters is the collateral a customer is able to post.With DeFi, instead of centralized players calling the shots, the exchanges of money are managed by a programmable piece of code called a smart contract. This contract is written on a public blockchain, like ethereum or solana, and it executes when certain conditions are met, negating the need for a central intermediary. Consequently, the annual returns advertised by DeFi platforms like Aave and Compound are much lower than what Celsius and Voyager once offered customers, and their rates vary based upon market forces, rather than staying fixed at unsustainable double-digit percentages.The tokens associated with these lending protocols are both massively up in the last month, which is a reflection of the enthusiasm for this corner of the crypto ecosystem.\"Gross yields (APR/APY) in DeFi are derived from token prices of relevant altcoins that are attributed to different liquidity pools, the prices of which we have seen tumble more than 70% since November,\" explained Fundstrat's Teng.In practice, DeFi loans function more like sophisticated trading products, rather than a standard loan.\"That's not a retail or mom-and-pop product. You have to be quite advanced and have a take on the market,\" said Otto Jacobsson, who worked in debt capital markets at a bank in London for three years, before transitioning into crypto.Teng believes lenders who did not aggressively extend uncollateralized loans, or have since liquidated their counterparties, will remain solvent. Genesis' Michael Moro, for example, has come out to say they have cut significant counter-party risk.\"Rates offered to creditors will, and have, compressed. However, lending remains a hugely profitable business (second only to exchange trading), and prudent risk managers will survive the crypto winter,\" said Teng.In fact Celsius, though itself a CeFi lender, also diversified its holdings in the DeFi ecosystem by parking some of its crypto cash in these decentralized finance platforms as a way to earn yield. Days before declaring bankruptcy, Celsius began to pay back many of its liens with DeFi lenders like Maker and Aave, in order to unlock its collateral.\"This is actually the biggest advertisement to date of how smart contracts work,\" explained Andrew Keys, co-founder of Darma Capital, which invests in applications, developer tools, and protocols around ethereum.\"The fact that Celsius is paying back Aave, Compound, and Maker before humans should explain smart contracts to humanity,\" continued Keys. \"These are persistent software objects that are non-negotiable.\"watch nowVIDEO2:4302:43Czech prince turns to NFTs to preserve family historyThe News with Shepard Smith] \n",

Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesCoinbase is footing the bill for a lawsuit filed against the Treasury Department Thursday by users of the recently sanctioned crypto service, Tornado Cash.The six plaintiffs include Coinbase employees and other users of the mixing service that was blacklisted by the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in August.Mixing services like Tornado Cash are used to obfuscate crypto transactions, which while anonymous, are easily traceable. The Treasury Department argued this particular service was used to launder more than $7 billion worth of digital currency in the past three years by North Korean hackers and other bad actors.But in some cases, mixing services are used for legitimate privacy reasons. One plaintiff, a senior security risk analyst at Coinbase, used the service to anonymize donations to Ukraine out of fear his address would be targeted by Russian hacking groups. Another had concerns about his family's security.\"Each is an American who simply wants to engage in entirely lawful activity in private,\" according to the lawsuit.The sanctions were a unique move by Treasury to blacklist open source software, versus an entity or person. Crypto enthusiasts have argued that the move was an overstep, sets a new legal precedent and could cause negative ripple effects for the tech industry.\"We saw this as a much larger problem,\" Coinbase's chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, told CNBC. \"It sets a dangerous precedent -- if this code can be designated without any limits imposed by law, any technology any tool or system could be fair game.\"Grewal, former deputy general counsel at Facebook, said it could have a chilling effect on innovation. He likened the Tornado Cash scenario to police chasing armed robbers on a highway. In order to catch the criminals, \"we wouldn't ban all use of that highway.\" Grewal said it was the first time Coinbase has financially supported an external lawsuit and plans to pay for the plaintiffs' lawyers, as well as other costs associated with pursuing the claims in federal court.Thursday's suit argues that the move went a step beyond Treasury's authority, and as Coinbase put it in a blog post uses \"a hammer instead of a scalpel.\" The plaintiffs argue it caused financial harm as their money is still locked on Tornado Cash, and hurt users relying on the tools for privacy reasons. The case asks the Court to remove Tornado Cash smart contracts from the U.S. sanctions list.Coinbase is the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume and has publicly advocated for crypto reforms in Washington, while dealing with a series of recent SEC probes. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested information from Coinbase about the listing of cryptocurrencies that the agency argues may have been unregistered securities. The SEC is also looking into its crypto rewards program, known as staking.\"We have advocated for regulatory reform across Washington and that work will continue,\" Grewal said. \"We can continue to cooperate and partner with the agencies that are being challenged in this instance, because this is not about questioning anyone's good faith, but it is about assuring that the rule of law applies.\"] \n",

The crytpo market has been plagued with a number of issues from collapsed projects to bankruptcies.Nurphoto | Getty ImagesProminent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital issued a notice on Monday morning, stating that the fund failed to repay a loan of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $323 million at today's prices.3AC's solvency crunch comes after weeks of turmoil in the crypto market, which has erased hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Bitcoin and ether are both trading slightly lower in the last 24 hours, though well off their all-time highs. Meanwhile, the overall crypto market cap sits at about $950 billion, down from around $3 trillion at its peak in Nov. 2021.Voyager said it intends to pursue recovery from 3AC (Three Arrows Capital). In the interim, the broker emphasized that the platform continues to operate and fulfill customer orders and withdrawals. That assurance is likely an attempt to contain fear of contagion through the wider crypto ecosystem.\"We are working diligently and expeditiously to strengthen our balance sheet and pursuing options so we can continue to meet customer liquidity demands,\" said Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich.watch nowVIDEO8:1808:18How a $60 billion crypto collapse got regulators worriedCryptoAs of Friday, Voyager said it had approximately $137 million in U.S. dollars and owned crypto assets. The company also noted that it has access to a $200 million cash and USDC revolver, as well as a 15,000 bitcoin ($318 million) revolver from Alameda Ventures.Last week, Alameda (FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried's quantitative trading firm) committed $500 million in financing to Voyager Digital, a crypto brokerage. Voyager has already pulled $75 million from that line of credit.\"The default of 3AC does not cause a default in the agreement with Alameda,\" the statement said.CNBC did not immediately receive a comment from 3AC.How did 3AC get here?Three Arrows Capital was established in 2012 by Zhu Su and Kyle Davies.Zhu is known for his incredibly bullish view of bitcoin. He said last year the world's largest cryptocurrency could be worth $2.5 million per coin. But in May this year, as the crypto market began its meltdown, Zhu said on Twitter that his \"supercycle price thesis was regrettably wrong.\"The onset of a new so-called \"crypto winter\" has hurt digital currency projects and companies across the board.Three Arrow Capital's problems appeared to begin earlier this month after Zhu tweeted a rather cryptic message that the company is \"in the process of communicating with relevant parties\" and is \"fully committed to working this out.\"There was no follow-up about what the specific issues were.But the Financial Times reported after the tweet that U.S.-based crypto lenders BlockFi and Genesis liquidated some of 3AC's positions, citing people familiar with the matter. 3AC had borrowed from BlockFi but was unable to meet the margin call.A margin call is a situation in which an investor has to commit more funds to avoid losses on a trade made with borrowed cash.Then the so-called algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD and its sister token luna collapsed.3AC had exposure to Luna and suffered losses.\"The Terra-Luna situation caught us very much off guard,\" 3AC co-founder Davies told the Wall Street Journal in an interview earlier this month.watch nowVIDEO6:0806:08What's going on in the crypto market right now?Street Signs EuropeContagion risk?Three Arrows Capital is still facing a credit crunch exacerbated by the continued pressure on cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin hovered around the $21,000 level on Monday and is down about 53% this year.Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled further interest rate hikes in a bid to control rampant inflation, which has taken the steam out of riskier assets.3AC, which is one of the biggest crypto-focused hedge funds, has borrowed large sums of money from various companies and invested across a number of different digital asset projects. That has sparked fears of further contagion across the industry.\"The issue is that the value of their [3AC's] assets as well has declined massively with the market, so all in all, not good signs,\" Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development and international at crypto exchange Luno, told CNBC.\"What's to be seen is whether there are any large, remaining players that had exposure to them, which could cause further contagion.\"Already, a number of crypto firms are facing liquidity crises because of the market slump. This month, lending firm Celsius, which promised users super high yields for depositing their digital currency, paused withdrawals for customers, citing \"extreme market conditions.\"Another crypto lender, Babel Finance, said this month that it is \"facing unusual liquidity pressures\" and halted withdrawals.— CNBC's Ryan Browne contributed to this report.watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

The mantra was \"leave no trace\" so everything was gone by sunrise.\"It's very illegal but also very crypto,\" explained one of the roughly 100 party attendees, who declined to be identified for fear of alerting the Paris police.She also said the trek was one of the most ridiculous things she's ever done in her life. The expedition included crawling under a fence, wiggling down caves, tracing the path of old train tracks, wading through thigh-deep, muddy water — and a bit of bouldering.\"There was a gap in the rocks, and I didn't think anything of it. I was just like, 'Oh, we're pausing here,' and then a human popped out,\" the attendee explained.Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwardsTrekking to the Catacombs party involved wading through water at one pointAnonymous party goerMultiple squads gathered across the 14th arrondissement of Paris late Saturday night to sneak into the underground landmark. Each team was assembled via an anonymous Telegram group and assigned its own entrance.\"You got a link and a password to a survey form, and you basically answered some questions and gave your Telegram. If you were chosen for this adventure, you got added to a Telegram group with a handful of other people you didn't know, and the guide dropped into the thread on the day-of to tell you a meeting spot,\" recounted the attendee.Another partygoer turned on their fitness tracker to map the distance and found they had traveled four and a half miles underground.All the paths converged on a large central cave, where there was a DJ, a bar with neon lights, candles, and people dancing.The only downside to an underground rave hosted in a mass grave?\"People start thinking, 'Er, where am I gonna get out?'\" said another person who attended.Welcome to the Ethereum Community Conference, an annual event that draws the world's top developers and cryptographers to the City of Light. The event officially kicked off Tuesday morning, but key players in the space descended on Paris days in advance to take part in ancillary events like the Metaverse Summit and a Parisian-style salon dubbed The Future of Content in Web3. And for the parties like La Degen and Raave.Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwardsPhoto taken while en route to secret, underground party in the Catacombs of ParisAnonymous party goerEthCC: 'Not Bitcoin Miami'EthCC is in some ways the opposite of Bitcoin Miami, the highest profile crypto conference.While Bitcoin Miami boasts attendance in the tens of thousands, EthCC deliberately capped tickets at 2,000 to keep it small and intimate. CNBC spoke to nearly a dozen people on the ground in Paris who weren't able to buy a ticket before the event sold out, but came to town anyway just to participate in all the side events.\"They kept it tailored and small intentionally, because they could easily have sold more tickets,\" said Samantha Yap, who's helping to coordinate EthCC.The event comes at a difficult time for the crypto industry. Major names like Three Arrows Capital and lenders like Celsius and Voyager Digital have all filed for bankruptcy, and the knock-on effect has been brutal, shaking overall confidence in the sector — and raising questions about the current state of the decentralized finance (or DeFi) ecosystem.\"I think a lot of projects were completely without substance,\" developer Max Saal said of the many companies that cropped up in 2021 amid the boom in token prices. \"It's a deterrent for people who are...actually building something real.\"Meanwhile, ethereum is also on the precipice of a years-in-the-making upgrade that will be its most significant overhaul since the digital currency was launched nearly a decade ago. There's a lot at stake with this roll-out.Cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin are often criticized for the process of mining to generate new coins. Both currently use a so-called proof-of-work mining model, where miners race to solve complex math equations using banks of powerful computers.Ethereum has been working to shift from the energy-intensive proof-of-work method for securing the network to a proof-of-stake model, which requires users to leverage their existing cache of ether as a means to verify transactions and mint new tokens. This requires far less power and will translate to faster transactions.The transition has been repeatedly pushed back for the last several years because of major flaws in the implementations. But a series of dress rehearsals in the last few months have shown promising signs that all will go smoothly when the so-called \"merge\" happens in September.If things don't go well, there is a question of what impact that might have on digital assets more broadly. Take DeFi, which aims to recreate traditional financial systems like banks, but with cryptocurrency. They mostly run on the ethereum blockchain. It is unclear what would happen to large swaths of the DeFi ecosystem should there be any hiccups with the big transition to proof-of-stake later this year.But the vibe on the ground at EthCC is overwhelmingly positive, with most people excited that a bear market translates to no grifters because there's no fast, easy profit to be made.Dani Osorio, who has spent the last several years working in infrastructure and developer relations and organized the EthDenver conference eariler this year, tells CNBC that there are a lot of blockchain and crypto conferences around the world, but EthCC is the only one that's focused on the technical participants.\"You'll see CTOs, technical founders, cryptographers, and protocol researchers. That's unheard of,\" said Osorio, who added that she met ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in a courtyard in Paris back in 2018 at the first EthCC venue.Felice Schimmel represents TikTok celebrities, and she began to go down the rabbit hole of web3 in Nov. 2021. She came to Paris to better understand the conversations happening among insiders, especially as regulation becomes more of an international conversation.\"[Web3] allows you to have an opportunity to own your fans and your followers. That allows you to connect with them without having a platform in the middle of that conversation.\"Not even a Bohemian prince hailing from a 600-year-old noble family in the Czech Republic was able to grab a ticket in time before they sold out. But William Lobkowicz — who has spent the last year minting his family's collection of 20,000 cultural objects as NFTs — flew in from Prague anyway to talk shop with some of the brightest minds in the blockchain ecosystem.\"I come from an industry that is struggling and where drastic change is needed for sustainable and long-lasting development,\" he told CNBC. \"What if conventional no longer works?\"People don't talk price charts or markets at EthCC, but ether is currently rallying after a stretch of depressing pricing. Ether is the token native to the ethereum blockchain, and it is up almost 40% in the last five days, after a long plunge that took it down nearly 70% from its peak last November.watch nowVIDEO3:5003:50Crypto bankruptcies spread through digital asset landscape as cheap money dries upTechCheck] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [Do Kwon, co-founder and chief executive officer of Terraform Labs, leaves the company's office in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, April 14, 2022.Woohae Cho | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDo Kwon, the 30-year-old South Korean founder of a $60 billion stablecoin project that imploded last month, has a knack for convincing people to buy what he's selling. Most recently, Kwon sold his vision of a new kind of payment system that would upend the status quo and replace the world's currencies.TerraUSD (also called UST) and its sister token, luna, moved in lockstep. UST functioned as a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin meant to replace global fiat transactions, while luna helped UST keep its peg and earned investors a killing as it appreciated in value. (In 2021, luna was up 15,800%.) Traders were also able to arbitrage the system and profit from deviations in the prices of the two tokens.The setup wasn't new. Algorithmic stablecoins, which rely on a complex set of code rather than hard currency reserves to stabilize their price, have been a thing since at least 2015 — and the idea of staking crypto to earn an unrealistically high return exploded in popularity in the last few years alongside the rise of decentralized finance, or DeFi.But Kwon had a real touch for marketing. He cast himself in the likeness of a next-gen Satoshi Nakamoto (the pseudonymous name given to the founder of bitcoin), crossed with the social media swagger of an Elon Musk.watch nowVIDEO8:3308:33How Terra's failed stablecoin could lead to a host of legal problemsCrypto WorldKwon raised $207 million for his Terraform Labs, which launched luna and UST, and his almost shameless level of online bravado, in which he shunned the \"poor\" (that is, luna skeptics) on Twitter, drew in the masses. He inspired an almost cult-like following of self-identifying LUNAtics — including billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who went so far as to memorialize his membership in this club with a tattoo on his arm.Terra's Anchor platform, which really helped to put UST on the map with its outsized return of 20%, could have been a big red flag for savvy investors. Many analysts believed it was unsustainable. At the time, government bonds were paying around 2% and savings accounts less than 1%. But investors piled in anyway, giving luna and UST a combined market value of almost $60 billion at one point.Now, both tokens are essentially worthless. The failure was so massive, it helped drag down the entire crypto asset class, erasing half a trillion dollars from the sector's market cap. It also dented investor confidence in the whole space.It was reportedly Kwon's second failed attempt at launching an algorithmic stablecoin, though his first effort saw losses in the range of tens of millions of dollars, rather than tens of billions.But Kwon is already on to his third attempt at launching his own cryptocurrency, and investors are jumping back in with him. The government, however, likely won't be as forgiving.A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the prospect of civil or criminal proceedings facing Terraform Labs or Kwon. But former federal prosecutors and regulators tell CNBC that the fallout from the stablecoin chaos could mean fines, penalties — or, in a worst case scenario for Kwon, time behind bars.Criminal cases unlikelyIn America, it is not a crime to be a lousy businessman or a careless CEO with poor judgement.In the case of Kwon, prosecutors would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kwon or his associates committed criminal fraud — and that requires proof that the defendant intentionally deceived investors.\"It's not like a homicide where you bring in witnesses to testify to who pulled the trigger,\" explained Randall Eliason, who spent 12 years as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and prosecuted white-collar cases in federal court.\"We're trying to prove what was going on in someone's mind. That's often a very painstaking process that involves reviewing lots and lots of documents, and talking to many, many people and dealing with all their lawyers through that process and scheduling grand jury time and court appearances. It can really drag on, so no one should expect anything to happen overnight,\" he said.Even if prosecutors can show that a defendant made false statements, they have to prove the defendant's state of mind beyond a reasonable doubt, according to Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and trial attorney who has represented clients in derivative-related claims and securities class actions.\"Because we don't have a magic telescope to read a person's mind, prosecutors often rely on emails, texts, tweets and other statements,\" said Mariotti.The hope is to find a smoking gun, but prosecutors rarely find a single email or text message that lays out the whole fraud scheme.Instead, Eliason says, prosecutors look for little nuggets of information and communications. One classic way to build a fraud case like this would be to \"work up the ladder,\" building cases against lower-level participants, and then persuading them to cooperate and testify.Eliason cited the example of Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, which used other companies' machines to run blood samples but told investors that it was using its own machines to perform those tests.\"Things like that are pretty suggestive of intent to actually deceive and defraud,\" said Eliason, \"versus just misjudgments, mistakes, or other lesser forms of misconduct.\"White-collar cases are famous for taking months or even years. If they ultimately culminate in a conviction, the sentencing can be severe.Stefan Qin, the Australian founder of a $90 million cryptocurrency hedge fund, was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud. Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson, a Swedish national accused by the United States of defrauding over 3,500 victims of more than $16 million was sentenced to 15 years in prison for securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.Do Kwon, co-founder and chief executive officer of Terraform Labs, poses in the company's office in Seoul, South Korea, on Thursday, April 14, 2022.Woohae Cho | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLower bar for civil casesWhile prosecutors have to prove criminal wrongdoing beyond a reasonable doubt, the burden of proof for civil cases is much lower and typically based upon a \"preponderance of evidence.\"\"Frequently, in these kinds of cases, the appropriate remedies end up being civil, regulatory, and administrative — and actually not criminal,\" said Eliason.Civil cases could include lawsuits from crypto buyers who feel they were burned.A group of investors in South Korea have come together to file a complaint against Kwon and his Terraform Labs co-founder on two charges including fraud, according to reports from local media. (Multiple attorneys from the Seoul-based law firm LKB & Partners, which brought the suit, did not respond to requests for comment.)Civil penalties could also include fines or other consequences from regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Philip Moustakis, who served as senior counsel in the SEC's enforcement division, explains, \"The SEC would only have to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence, meaning a jury would have to find it was more likely than not the defendant engaged in the conduct alleged.\"Penalties could include injunctions, disgorgement (returning gains), or fines based on the amount of the loss, which Eliason says could potentially be \"pretty staggering\" given the tens of billions of dollars that was wiped out. Kwon already has a complicated history with the SEC that reportedly involves dodging a few subpoenas and filing a motion opposing the regulatory body.CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham tells CNBC that while she does not comment on any ongoing or potential litigation, \"The CFTC was among the first to successfully prosecute wrongdoing in cryptocurrencies\" and the agency continues \"to aggressively pursue crypto fraud and manipulation to the fullest extent of our authority.\"Outside the U.S., Kwon could be facing blowback in South Korea, where he currently lives and spent time operating his business, and Singapore, the official headquarters of Terraform Labs.Seoul is already flexing its authoritative muscle, as the country's national tax agency has reportedly ordered Kwon and Terraform Labs to pay $80 million (100 billion won) in back taxes. A once-defunct special unit dedicated to investigating financial and securities crimes in South Korea — literally dubbed the \"Yeouido Grim Reaper,\" in reference to Seoul's financial district — has been resurrected from a more than two-year dormancy to probe into the Terra collapse.watch nowVIDEO8:1508:15Bitcoin prices surge past $32,000, plus the legal fallout from Terra's collapse: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World\"There is going to be issues with jurisdiction ... since he's not in the U.S.,\" said Eliason. \"South Korean authorities might have something to say about possible sanctions. There are a lot of other potential agencies or governments who could take a look at this conduct, in addition to the private individuals who were harmed.\"Meanwhile, Terraform Labs is currently down a few lawyers, after its in-house legal team reportedly resigned following the crash. (CNBC reached out to counsel team members Marc Goldich, Lawrence Florio and Noah Axler on LinkedIn. All three indicated on their profiles that they left the company in May 2022, but they did not respond to requests for comment.)A spokesperson for Terraform Labs tells CNBC that \"recent times have been challenging for Terraform Labs, and a small number of team members have left,\" though they noted that \"the vast majority of team members remain committed to carrying out the project's mission.\"Kwon's latest do-overSo far, Kwon hasn't skipped a beat.Within days of the UST catastrophe, the Terraform Labs founder already had a plan to ditch the failed UST stablecoin and relaunch a new luna token. Participants overwhelmingly voted in favor of following through with that plan and reviving the failed venture — even as Kwon amended the proposal while the tally was underway.A Terraform Labs spokesperson told CNBC that they made some technical corrections two days into the vote and alerted the community of the changes. \"There were still five days to vote at the time of the amendment. We encouraged people who disagreed with the amendment to vote no, and if they had already voted, to change their vote.\"The newly listed luna is currently down more than 10% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap — but the effort has a lot of big-name backers pushing for it to succeed.Any success with luna 2.0 could mean a chance to recoup losses for the institutional and retail investors who got wiped out. There was no backstop from the FDIC, nor any other consumer insurance protections, so this kind of token recovery plan was the only chance at redemption for investors who got left holding the bag.Major backers of Terraform Labs included some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coinbase Ventures. Three Arrows Capital and Jump Crypto bought into the luna token. Crypto heavyweights like Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao (also known as CZ) got in, as well. CZ, whose net worth is estimated to be $16.9 billion, recently lamented on Twitter that he was \"poor again,\" linking to an article headlined, \"Binance's luna investment was worth $1.6 billion. Now, it's less than $3,000.\"Binance and FTX both publicly backed Kwon's plan to relaunch and relist the luna token. And as Binance added luna 2.0 to its exchange on Tuesday, the coin initially saw a 90% price bump.Meanwhile the only person who has been taken in by authorities is a crypto investor accused of ringing the doorbell of Kwon's apartment in Seoul and asking Kwon's wife whether her husband was home. A report from the South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo says the suspect — who reportedly lost as much as $2.3 million following Terra's collapse — now faces trespassing charges.watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO3:4403:44Crypto Crackdown: Why federal charges over an alleged Ponzi scheme may only be the tip of the icebergWorldwide ExchangeEmbattled lending platform Celsius wants to bring back ex-CFO Rod Bolger and pay him about $92,000 a month, prorated over a period of at least six weeks. The embattled lender says it needs Bolger to help it navigate bankruptcy proceedings as an advisor, according to a motion filed with the Southern District of New York.\"Because of Mr. Bolger's familiarity with the Debtors' business, the Debtors have requested, and Mr. Bolger has agreed pending the Court's approval, to continue providing advisory and consulting services to the Debtors pursuant to an Advisory Agreement,\" the filing reads. \"In consideration for the advisory services rendered by Mr. Bolger, the Debtors agree to pay Mr. Bolger the sum of CAD $120,000 per month, prorated for partial months.\"The motion goes on to say that during Bolger's tenure, he led efforts to steady the business during turbulent market volatility this year, guiding the financial aspects of the business and acting as a leader of the company. Ultimately, it is up to New York's Southern District to decide whether to allow Bolger to come onboard with Celsius. There is a Zoom hearing set for Monday, Aug. 8, to consider the motion.Bolger, a former CFO for Royal Bank of Canada and divisions of Bank of America, was previously with the company for five months before resigning on June 30, about three weeks after the platform paused all withdrawals, citing \"extreme market conditions.\" While he worked full-time with the company as CFO, this motion shows that he had a base salary of $750,000 and a performance-based cash bonus of up to 75% of his base, in addition to stock and token options, bringing the top of his total income range to around $1.3 million.The company subsequently installed Chris Ferraro, then the head of financial planning, analysis, and investor relations for Celsius, to the post of CFO. Within days of his appointment, the company filed for bankruptcy.Once a titan of the crypto lending world, Celsius is in bankruptcy proceedings and facing down claims that it was running a Ponzi scheme by paying early depositors with the money it got from new users.At its peak in October 2021, CEO Alex Mashinsky said the crypto lender had $25 billion in assets under management. Now, Celsius is down to $167 million \"in cash on hand,\" which it says will provide \"ample liquidity\" to support operations during the restructuring process. Celsius owes its users around $4.7 billion, according to its bankruptcy filing.That filing also shows that Celsius has more than 100,000 creditors, some of whom lent the platform cash without any collateral to back up the arrangement. The list of its top 50 unsecured creditors includes Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, as well as an investment firm based in the Cayman Islands.Retail investors have filed pleas to the judge to help them recover some of their lost holdings, with some saying that their life savings have effectively been wiped out.A CPA and Celsius investor with a large balance trapped on the Celsius platform filed an objection on Tuesday to challenge the motion by Celsius to reinstate its former CFO.watch nowVIDEO3:4103:41Ethereum creator excited for crypto upgrade to minimize gas fees and make the blockchain more scalableClosing Bell] \n",

This was back when the price of bitcoin was around $900. Bitcoin is currently trading around $19,200.Along the way, Taihuttu has exited his bitcoin position and subsequently bought back in, trading his coins at opportune moments.\"That's the bitcoin life,\" he said.Taihuttu tells CNBC that he sold about 15% of the family's overall bitcoin holdings when the price fell to the $55,000 price level in late November.\"$55,000 for me was the confirmation that we would go lower,\" continued Taihuttu.Romaine and Joli Taihuttu on a beach in Lagos, PortugalDidi TaihuttuExtreme volatility is the price of doing business in the digital asset market. In the last decade, bitcoin has experienced two prolonged periods of depressed prices before it rebounded. In the previous crypto winter in 2018, bitcoin lost more than 80% of its value before bouncing back, eventually rising to its all-time high last year.\"There is still an aspect in crypto that we are waiting to see if another shoe will drop, if another entity will fail, if the credit cascade will continue,\" said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, in an interview.\"If your timeframe is a week, or a month, or even a quarter, I think there's still significant volatility. If you have a time horizon measured in years, then yes, this is a great opportunity to think about entering the market,\" continued Hougan.Taihuttu — who studies crypto market price charts and follows popular indicators like the Mayer Multiple — thinks in the current price cycle, bitcoin will bottom out somewhere between $15,000 to $20,000, before bouncing up to above $140,000 by 2025. And right now, according to Taihuttu, is the \"ultimate buying moment.\"His investment strategy has worked out pretty well thus far. Taihuttu tells CNBC his portfolio has gained more than 2,000% in the last six years.\"Slowly, people will understand that being in bitcoin and HODLing is more profitable than always trying to catch that altcoin that will go times thousands,\" said Taihuttu.watch nowVIDEO4:1704:17It just got harder and less profitable to mine for bitcoin as algorithm adjustsThe ExchangeTaihuttu's 70/30 ruleIn the last six years, the Dutch family of five has traveled the world. But after spending time in 40 countries, they decided to lay down some roots in Portugal — which is one of the last places in Europe with a 0% tax on bitcoin.Taihuttu's latest project is running a bitcoin bar on one of the most popular beaches in Lagos, in order to \"lead by example.\" He also plans to spread the gospel of bitcoin by converting all vendors along that stretch of sand into Lightning-friendly retailers. Lightning is a payments platform built on top of bitcoin's base layer that enables virtually instantaneous and low-fee transactions.\"I think it will take me about six months, and I will have this whole beach accepting bitcoin,\" he said.The family's faith has been tested this past year. It has been a rough few months for the crypto market, as token prices plummet and some of the most popular companies in the industry go belly up.The chaos has spooked investors, erasing more than $2 trillion in value in a matter of months — and wiping out the life savings of retail traders who bet big on crypto projects billed as safe investments. On Thursday, bitcoin posted its worst quarterly loss in more than a decade.Zoom In IconArrows pointing outwardsFirst clients paying in bitcoin at the Taihuttus' beach bar in Lagos, PortugalDidi TaihuttuTo stay \"emotionally grounded\" when faced with this level of volatility, the Dutch family of five follows what they call the 70/30 rule.At any one time, the Taihuttus keep 70% of their bitcoin holdings in cold storage (which is inaccessible without physically going to retrieve it), and the other 30% in a hot wallet, meaning that the coins are connected to the internet, whether through a mobile phone wallet or an online exchange.Of the 30% crypto stash, some is kept in bitcoin, and the rest is in a mix of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins including tether, USDC, and dai. This kind of \"hot\" storage allows owners relatively easy access to their tokens so that they can access and spend their crypto. The trade-off for convenience is potential exposure to bad actors.\"Every time our capital increases, I make sure that 70% is on the cold storage, so then I'm not able to touch it from there,\" explained Taihuttu.Taihuttu has gone out of his way to make his cold wallets especially difficult to access.Most of the family's crypto fortune is in secret vaults on four different continents, including two hiding spots in Europe, another two in Asia, one in South America, and a sixth in Australia. None of the sites are below ground or on a remote island, but the family told CNBC the crypto stashes are hidden in different ways and in a variety of locations, ranging from rental apartments and friends' homes to self-storage sites.Teddy, the Taihuttus' dog, on a beach in Lagos, Portugal with Jessa and RomaineDidi TaihuttuThe Taihuttus also hide the seed phrases (that is, a unique grouping of 12 to 24 words used to access digital assets) on the same continent as their corresponding hardware wallet, but in different countries. Seed phrases are different to the private keys used to access crypto wallets — but it is crucial that users keep a record of both.\"Cold storage often refers to crypto that has been moved to wallets whose private keys – the passwords that enable the crypto to be moved out of the wallet – are not stored on internet-connected computers, so that hackers can't hack into the computer and steal the private keys,\" said Philip Gradwell, chief economist of Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm.Beyond the upside of basic cyber hygiene and safeguarding his tokens against bad actors, Taihuttu has also gone out of his way to protect his holdings from himself.\"I think if I had those hardware wallets with me, I would maybe be more emotionally involved, and maybe when I see bitcoin dipping, then I would grab the hardware wallet and start to sell or buy,\" he said.That said, the Dutch father of five says he's never too far from either his ledger or the seed phrases.\"I can always fly cheap with RyanAir or AirAsia. In three hours, I'm there.\"Of the bitcoin that the Taihuttus have squirreled away around the world, nearly all of their coins are non-KYC'ed — meaning they're not subject to \"Know Your Customer\" rules that centralized exchanges require to prevent them from being used to launder money or engage in other illegal activity. That means that no one, including governments or friends, know exactly how much the Bitcoin Family has stored.To do this, Taihuttu has bought much of his bitcoin over-the-counter.\"There are lots of forums where you can still buy bitcoin with cash,\" Taihuttu told CNBC.\"Every country has its own desk. There's one in Mexico that does up to a million dollars per day in cash,\" continued Taihuttu, though he noted that you may have to buy at a premium when you purchase OTC.watch nowVIDEO3:3403:34Here's what it's like to get scanned into the metaverseCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [In this articleCELHFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTwatch nowVIDEO3:4403:44Crypto Crackdown: Why federal charges over an alleged Ponzi scheme may only be the tip of the icebergWorldwide ExchangeCelsius Network, once a titan of the crypto lending world, is in bankruptcy proceedings and facing down claims that it was running a Ponzi scheme by paying early depositors with the money it got from new users. Some of the 1.7 million customers ensnared by the alleged fraud are now directly pleading with the Southern District of New York to help them get their money back.Christian Ostheimer, a 37-year-old living in Connecticut, wrote in a letter included in court exhibits that he trusted Celsius with his retirement savings and has lost more than $30,000, which has brought him into \"unsurmountable tax complications.\"\"It is in your hands, honorable judge to make this a different case were not the lawyers, the attorneys, the big corporations and managers get paid out first but the little man, the mom and pop, the college grad, the granny and grandpa — all those many small unsecured creditors — so that they are not like usual at the end of the chain where they lose everything,\" wrote Ostheimer.The question of who gets repaid first — should that day ever come — looms heavy over the bankruptcy proceedings.At its peak in October 2021, CEO Alex Mashinsky said the crypto lender had $25 billion in assets under management. Now, Celsius is down to $167 million \"in cash on hand,\" which it says will provide \"ample liquidity\" to support operations during the restructuring process. Celsius owes its users around $4.7 billion, according to its bankruptcy filing.That filing also shows that Celsius has more than 100,000 creditors, some of whom lent the platform cash without any collateral to back up the arrangement. The list of its top 50 unsecured creditors includes Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, as well as an investment firm based in the Cayman Islands. Those creditors are likely first in line to get their money back, leaving smaller retail investors holding the bag.Unlike the traditional banking system, which typically insures customer deposits, there aren't formal consumer protections in place to safeguard user funds when things go wrong. Celsius spells out in its terms and conditions that any digital asset transferred to the platform constitutes a loan from the user to Celsius. Because there was no collateral put up by Celsius, customer funds were essentially just unsecured loans to the platform.Also in the fine print of Celsius' terms and conditions is a warning that in the event of bankruptcy, \"any Eligible Digital Assets used in the Earn Service or as collateral under the Borrow Service may not be recoverable\" and that customers \"may not have any legal remedies or rights in connection with Celsius' obligations.\" The disclosure reads like an attempt at blanket immunity from legal wrongdoing, should things ever go south.On July 19, Celsius published a document detailing next steps for customers. In it, the platform said its Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan will \"provide customers with the option, at the customers' election, to recover either cash at a discount or remain 'long' crypto,\" but it is unclear whether customers will ever see their money again.The entire process lays bare just how much of crypto regulation in the U.S. happens by enforcement.The Securities and Exchange Commission has effectively become one of the industry's top regulators in the country, including by weeding out Ponzi and pyramid schemes, and it appears that some precedent will be set in U.S. bankruptcy courts in coming months as lawmakers deliberate over formal legislation on Capitol Hill.Pleas from investorsIn the hundreds of letters officially submitted to the court, retail investors beg to be put at the front of the line to get their money back.Flori Ohm, a single mother of two college-bound daughters, said her family has been \"severely impacted both in financial and mental health\" by the bankruptcy, which has left her funds stranded on the platform. Ohm, who also supports her parents, said she can't sleep or focus on work.\"I am struggling hard [to make a] living,\" she wrote.Jeanne Y Savelle, who described herself as a \"little retired old lady\" living on a fixed income, said she turned to Celsius in search of a way to supplement her monthly Social Security check to stretch her dollar amid record levels of inflation.\"I purchased my small amount of crypto hoping just to earn enough to help me weather a few years, kind of a safety net,\" said Savelle. \"Yes, I know, buyer beware but I agree that there has been way too much deception.\"Others have lost everything.California resident Stephen Bralver said he has less than $1,000 left in his Wells Fargo checking account — now his only source of funds to provide for his family since Celsius suspended all withdrawals.\"There is absolutely no way that I can continue to provide without access to my assets at Celsius,\" he wrote to Judge Martin Glenn, who is overseeing the Celsius bankruptcy proceedings in New York.\"This is an EMERGENCY situation, simply to keep a roof over my family and food on their table,\" Bralver wrote.Sean Moran of Dublin wrote that he lost the family farm in Ireland and his family is homeless.\"Can't believe that they lied to us on the weekly AMA [ask-me-anything events] about not trusting banks whilst all along they we're wolfs in sheep clothing false promises and misleading information,\" Moran wrote. \"I'm mentally unstable. Family are distraught with my decisions of trusting Celsius and promising them a better future.\"Beyond the financial devastation described in each of these letters, one recurring theme centers around a sense of betrayal over the breach of trust between Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and his customers.Three weeks after Celsius halted all withdrawals due to \"extreme market conditions\" — and a few days before the crypto lender ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection — the platform was still advertising in big bold text on its website annual returns of nearly 19%, which paid out weekly.\"Transfer your crypto to Celsius and you could be earning up to 18.63% APY in minutes,\" the website read July 3.Ralphael DiCicco, who disclosed holdings of roughly $15,557 in crypto assets on Celsius, said he was fooled by the marketing.\"I believed in all the commercials, social media and advertising that showed Celsius was a high yield, low risk savings account. We were ensured that our funds are safer at Celsius than in a bank,\" wrote DiCicco.\"This money is pretty much my life savings ... I hope you can find it the best interest of all parties involved to pay back the smaller investors first ... before any restructuring occurs,\" DiCicco continued.Travis Rodgers of Phoenix said that he was told on numerous phone calls to Celsius Network, as recently as two days before it locked depositors' accounts, that there was no danger to client assets and zero probability of bankruptcy. Rodgers said he recorded several of those calls. He said his Celsius holdings total $40,000 across 11 cryptocurrencies.The weekly ask-me-anything events hosted by Mashinsky on YouTube were mentioned in multiple letters, including one sent in by Stephen Richardson, who itemized the many ways in which he feels Mashinsky deceived the public in order to lure new customers into the scheme.Richardson said he watched every single Friday AMA since signing up.\"Alex would talk about how Celsius is safer than banks because they supposedly don't rehypothecate and use fractional reserve lending like the banks do,\" wrote Richardson. \"I currently have six figures worth of crypto locked in my Celsius account unable to be withdrawn, despite Alex's claims mere hours before withdrawals were closed that nobody has any issue withdrawing from Celsius and that everything you hear to the contrary is simply 'fud' [fear, uncertainty and doubt].\"Some said they have even contemplated suicide if they can't retrieve their funds.Katie Davis of Australia pleaded with the judge for the return of the $138,000 she and her husband have stranded on the Celsius platform.\"The thought of losing that amount of money is horrifying,\" Davis wrote.\"If I do not get that back, I will end my life as the loss will impact my family and I significantly,\" she wrote.Mashinsky did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.If you or someone you know is in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.watch nowVIDEO3:4103:41Ethereum creator excited for crypto upgrade to minimize gas fees and make the blockchain more scalableClosing Bell] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO3:0803:08Voyager Digital files for bankruptcy amid crypto lender solvency crisisWorldwide ExchangeCrypto lending platforms like Celsius, Anchor, and Voyager Digital rose to prominence for offering almost unbelievable returns of up to 20% annually on customer deposits. Now much of that crypto cash is trapped, as plunging token prices force platforms to temporarily suspend or limit withdrawals.In the wake of its own solvency crisis, Celsius — which is still advertising up to 18.63% annual yield on its website — has had customer funds on ice for more than three weeks and has yet to announce tangible guidance on next steps.So who is going to be left holding the bag if these platforms go belly up?Unlike the traditional banking system, which typically insures customer deposits, there aren't formal consumer protections in place to safeguard user funds when things go wrong on decentralized finance platforms. 'High risk, high reward' is the general motto of the DeFi ecosystem. For those who lost their life savings to these crypto lending platforms, there is little recourse for recouping their losses.But Shehan Chandrasekera, a certified public accountant, tells CNBC the U.S. tax code may provide some relief to these investors by way of an obscure deduction.\"If your funds become totally worthless and irrecoverable, you may be eligible to write them off as a nonbusiness bad debt on your taxes,\" said Chandrasekera, lead tax strategist at CoinTracker.io, a digital currency tax software company that helps clients track their crypto across virtual wallet addresses and manage their tax obligations.\"It's not going to cover up your entire economic loss, but it's going to give you some type of tax benefit, because at least you get to write off that initial investment that you put in,\" Chandrasekera.How you might qualifyYou can think of a nonbusiness bad debt as a type of loss resulting from a debt extended to another party, which has been rendered totally worthless and irrecoverable.CPA Lewis Taub stresses that there must be a complete loss of all that was lent to the platform in order for the debt to be considered deductible. Partial losses don't count. The freezing of accounts, or limited withdrawals by crypto platforms, does not constitute a total loss.At this stage, many of the crypto platforms are still calling the freezes \"temporary\" as they figure out how to shore up some liquidity, whether through restructuring or securing additional lines of credit.Chandrasekera says that a debt falls into this category of \"totally uncollectible\" only after all attempts at collection have failed. So technically, none of the crypto funds on deposit at these platforms are completely worthless.\"It's also deemed worthless if the borrower files for bankruptcy and the debt is discharged,\" Chandrasekera explained in a tweet thread detailing how filers could claim the deduction.However, Taub says that even if a platform declares bankruptcy, the holders may still get something in bankruptcy court, so it's still not a total loss. Voyager Digital, for example, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Tuesday evening, but it's not yet clear whether users will be able to recover some of their losses through this process.Determining whether the cash you have given to a crypto platform constitutes a loan isn't always straightforward. For example, crypto coins and stocks, both of which are considered to be nondebt instruments, do not qualify for this write-off.\"In order to have a nonbusiness bad debt, there needs to be an actual debtor-creditor relationship. So to the extent that crypto was loaned to a platform, that criteria is met,\" said Taub, who is the director of tax services at Berkowitz Pollack Brant, one of the largest public accounting firms in Florida. Take Celsius. It spells out in its terms and conditions that any digital asset transferred to the platform constitutes a loan from the user to Celsius.Not all platforms are this transparent in their terms and conditions, however. Neither Voyager nor BlockFi clearly describe the relationship that the user has with the platform, according to Chandrasekera.That's also why CPAs advise that those affected by crypto platform suspensions reach out to a financial advisor to see whether their investment qualifies.\"You have to talk to an advisor and see, 'OK, what kind of relationship do I have? Does it look or does it smell like debt?'\" continued Chandrasekera.\"Because if you're earning something like a reward, you could argue that it's an interest income that you're getting,\" he said. \"So in those platforms, you have to kind of go one by one and see what type of relationship you have with the platform.\"Claiming the deductionShould the crypto lending platform meet the aforementioned criteria, an individual can report the initial value of the cryptocurrency (that is, the cost basis) when it was first lent to the platform as a short-term capital loss.Let's take the case of a hypothetical crypto investor named Dan, who bought bitcoin for $10,000 in 2020. In 2022, Dan then lent that same bitcoin, now worth $50,000, to a DeFi platform offering him 15% APY on his bitcoin. This platform then suffers an insolvency crunch and goes belly up, rendering Dan's debt totally worthless. In that case, Chandrasekera says Dan would be able to claim his basis of $10,000 as a nonbusiness bad debt.There are certain capital loss limitations to keep in mind, namely the fact that nonbusiness bad debt is always considered a short-term capital loss.In the case of Dan, therefore, if he does not have any other capital gains (from stocks or other crypto investments) lined up for this tax year, Chandrasekera says that out of the $10,000 total nonbusiness bad debt, he could deduct $3,000 this year and carry forward the balance of $7,000 to offset future capital gains.As for the actual mechanics of reporting nonbusiness bad debt, the deduction goes on Form 8949 as a short-term capital loss. That's where a user also files their crypto and stock gains and losses.Chandrasekera notes that you have to attach a \"bad debt statement\" to the return explaining the nature of this loss, as well. Among other details, that must include \"efforts you made to collect the debt and why you decided the debt was worthless,\" according to the IRS.The IRS warns that if you later recover or collect some of the bad debt you've deducted, you might have to include it in your gross income.The 'wash sale rule'Taub says that these days — to the extent that there are potential losses on actual holdings of crypto — he is advising clients to take advantage of the fact that \"wash sale rules\" do not apply to crypto. He tells CNBC that investors should really be watching their portfolio to consider \"harvesting losses\" to offset capital gains on other investments.Because the IRS classifies digital currencies like bitcoin as property, losses on crypto holdings are treated much differently than losses on stocks and mutual funds, according to former Onramp Invest CEO Tyrone Ross. With crypto tokens, wash sale rules don't apply, meaning that you can sell your bitcoin and buy it right back, whereas with a stock, you would have to wait 30 days to buy it back.This nuance in the tax code is huge for crypto holders in the U.S., primarily because it paves the way for tax-loss harvesting.\"One thing savvy investors do is sell at a loss and buy back bitcoin at a lower price,\" explained Chandrasekera. \"You want to look as poor as possible.\"The more losses you can rack up, the better it is for the investor's tax situation in the long run.\"You can harvest an unlimited amount of losses and carry them forward into an unlimited number of tax years,\" Chandrasekera added.Because the wash sale rule doesn't apply, investors can harvest their crypto losses more aggressively than with stocks, because there's no baked-in waiting period.\"I see people doing this every month, every week, every quarter, depending on their sophistication,\" he said. \"You can collect so many of these losses.\"Accruing these losses is how investors ultimately offset their future gains.When an individual goes to liquidate their crypto stake, they can use these collected losses to bring down what they owe to the IRS through the capital gains tax.Quickly buying back the crypto is another key part of the equation. If timed correctly, buying the dip enables investors to catch the ride back up, if the price of the digital coin rebounds.So let's say a taxpayer purchases one bitcoin for $10,000 and sells it for $50,000. This individual would face $40,000 of taxable capital gains. But if this same taxpayer had previously harvested $40,000 worth of losses on earlier crypto transactions, they'd be able to offset the tax they owe.It's a strategy that is catching on among CoinTracker users, according to Chandrasekera.Still, he cautioned that thorough bookkeeping is essential.\"Without detailed records of your transaction and cost basis, you cannot substantiate your calculations to the IRS,\" he warned.WATCH: Bitcoin prices slip, crypto winter's latest victimwatch nowVIDEO8:0308:03Bitcoin prices slip, crypto winter's latest victim, and the hype over Polygon: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World] \n",

The SEC alleges that for more than two years, the setup functioned like a standard pyramid scheme, in which investors earned profits by recruiting others into the operation. In the SEC's formal complaint, Wall Street's top watchdog calls Forsage a \"textbook pyramid and Ponzi scheme,\" in which Forsage aggressively promoted its smart contracts through online promotions and new investment platforms, all while not selling \"any actual, consumable product.\" The complaint adds that \"the primary way for investors to make money from Forsage was to recruit others into the scheme.\"The SEC said Forsage operated a typical Ponzi structure, wherein it allegedly used assets from new investors to pay earlier ones.\"As the complaint alleges, Forsage is a fraudulent pyramid scheme launched on a massive scale and aggressively marketed to investors,\" Carolyn Welshhans, acting chief of the SEC's Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, wrote in a news release.\"Fraudsters cannot circumvent the federal securities laws by focusing their schemes on smart contracts and blockchains.\"Forsage, through its support platform, declined to provide a method for contacting the company and did not offer comment.Four of the 11 people charged by the SEC are founders of Forsage. Their current whereabouts are unknown, but they were last known to be living in Russia, the Republic of Georgia and Indonesia.Three of the 11 people are U.S.-based individuals charged as promoters who endorsed Forsage on their social media platforms: Samuel D. Ellis, of Louisville, Kentucky, Mark F. Hamlin, of Henrico, Virginia, and Sarah L. Theissen, of Hartford, Wisconsin. Ellis and Theissen, neither of whom admitted nor denied the allegations, agreed to settle the charges, subject to court approval.Forsage was launched in January 2020. Regulators around the world have tried a couple of times to shut it down. Cease-and-desist actions were brought against Forsage first in September 2020 by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines. In March 2021, Montana's commissioner of securities and insurance tried the same. Despite this, the defendants allegedly continued to promote the scheme while denying the claims in several YouTube videos and by other means.TuesdayEthereum coinJakub Porzycki | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesCrypto startup Nomad lost almost $200 million in a devastating security exploit. Nomad is known as a \"bridge,\" where users can transfer tokens from one blockchain to another. Hackers exploited a security flaw that let users enter any value into the system and siphon off the funds, even if there weren't enough assets available in Nomad's deposit base.The nature of the bug meant that users didn't need any programming skills to exploit it. Others caught on and deployed armies of bots to carry out copycat attacks.\"Without prior programming experience, any user could simply copy the original attackers' transaction call data and substitute the address with theirs to exploit the protocol,\" said Victor Young, founder and chief architect of crypto startup Analog.\"Unlike previous attacks, the Nomad hack became a free-for-all where multiple users started to drain the network by simply replaying the original attackers' transaction call data.\"Blockchain bridges are a popular way of moving tokens off networks such as ethereum, which has gained a reputation for slow transaction times and high fees, into cheaper, more efficient blockchains. But sloppy programming choices have made them a prime target for hackers seeking to swindle investors out of millions. More than $1 billion worth of crypto has been lost to bridge exploits so far in 2022, according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic.\"I can only hope that developers and projects will learn that they are running a critical piece of software,\" Adrian Hetman, tech lead at Web3 security firm Immunefi, told CNBC.\"They need to keep the security first, be security first at every business decision because they are dealing with people's money; a lot of that money is locked in those contracts.\"Nomad said it's working with crypto security firm TRM Labs and law enforcement to trace the movement of funds, identify the perpetrators behind the attack and return stolen tokens to users.\"Nomad is committed to keeping its community updated as it learns more in the coming hours and days and appreciates all those who acted quickly to protect funds,\" the company said in the statement.Michael Saylor, chairman and chief executive officer of MicroStrategy, first got into bitcoin in 2020, when he decided to start adding the cryptocurrency to MicroStrategy's balance sheet as part of an unorthodox treasury management strategy.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLater Tuesday, MicroStrategy announced CEO Michael Saylor is leaving his role to become executive chairman of the company. The company's president, Phong Le, will take the reins from Saylor.Saylor has been the CEO since he launched the company in 1989. MicroStrategy went public in 1998.MicroStrategy's stock is down over 48% this year. Bitcoin is down over 51% during that same time period.\"I believe that splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO will enable us to better pursue our two corporate strategies of acquiring and holding bitcoin and growing our enterprise analytics software business,\" Saylor said in a news release. \"As Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations.\" The news came as the company announced its second-quarter earnings, in which its total revenues dropped by 2.6% compared with a year ago. The company also reported an impairment charge of $918 million on the value of its digital assets, presumably primarily bitcoin.MicroStrategy may technically be in the business of enterprise software and cloud-based services, but Saylor has said the publicly traded company doubles as the first and only bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund in the U.S.\"We're kind of like your nonexistent spot ETF,\" Saylor told CNBC on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami in April.Late Tuesday, early WednesdaySolana logo displayed on a phone screen and representation of cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on August 21, 2021.Jakub Porzycki | NurPhoto | Getty ImagesAnd then on Tuesday night, unknown attackers came after hot wallets connected to the solana blockchain.Nearly 8,000 digital wallets have been drained of just over $5.2 million in digital coins, including solana's sol token and USD coin, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The Twitter account Solana Status confirmed the attack, noting that as of Wednesday morning, approximately 7,767 wallets have been affected by the exploit. Elliptic's estimate is slightly higher at 7,936 wallets.Solana's sol token, one of the largest cryptocurrencies after bitcoin and ether, fell about 8% in the first two hours after the hack was initially detected, according to data from CoinMarketCap. It's currently down about 1%, while trading volume is up about 105% in the last 24 hours.Starting Tuesday evening, multiple users began reporting that assets held in \"hot\" wallets — that is, internet-connected addresses, including Phantom, Slope and Trust Wallet — had been emptied of funds.Phantom said on Twitter that it's investigating the \"reported vulnerability in the solana ecosystem\" and doesn't believe it's a Phantom-specific issue. Blockchain audit firm OtterSec tweeted that the hack has affected multiple wallets \"across a wide variety of platforms.\"Elliptic chief scientist Tom Robinson told CNBC the root cause of the breach is still unclear, but \"it appears to be due to a flaw in certain wallet software, rather than in the solana blockchain itself.\" OtterSec added that the transactions were being signed by the actual owners, \"suggesting some sort of private key compromise.\" A private key is a secure code that grants the owner access to their crypto holdings.The identity of the attacker is still unknown, as is the root cause of the exploit. The breach is ongoing.\"Engineers from multiple ecosystems, with the help of several security firms, are investigating drained wallets on solana,\" according to Solana Status, a Twitter account that shares updates for the entire solana network.The solana network is strongly encouraging users to use hardware wallets, since there's no evidence those have been impacted.\"Do not reuse your seed phrase on a hardware wallet — create a new seed phrase. Wallets drained should be treated as compromised, and abandoned,\" reads one tweet. Seed phrases are a collection of random words generated by a crypto wallet when it is first set up, and it grants access to the wallet.A private key is unique and links a user to their blockchain address. A seed phrase is a fingerprint of all of a user's blockchain assets that is used as a backup if a crypto wallet is lost.The solana network was viewed as one of the most promising newcomers in the crypto market, with backers such as Chamath Palihapitiya and Andreessen Horowitz touting it as a challenger to ethereum with faster transaction processing times and enhanced security. But it's been faced with a spate of issues lately, including downtime in periods of activity and a perception of being more centralized than ethereum.Correction: This story has been updated to name the three defendants the SEC is charging as U.S.-based promoters who endorsed Forsage on their social media platforms. A previous version incorrectly said these defendants were not named in the SEC's press release that announced the charges. watch nowVIDEO3:4103:41Ethereum creator excited for crypto upgrade to minimize gas fees and make the blockchain more scalableClosing Bell] \n",

The pain is being felt across much of the tech sector, with Uber and Facebook parent Meta taking similar steps, and Robinhood cutting headcount by about 9%.Prior to the 2022 downturn, Coinbase had been among the highest flyers in the tech industry. The company tripled the size of its staff last year to 3,730 employees.

With bitcoin down by more than one-third this year and ethereum off by 50%, fewer people are racing to Coinbase to open accounts and make transactions.Coinbase said last month that revenue in the latest quarter fell 27% from a year earlier, while total trading volume declined from $547 billion in the fourth quarter to $309 billion in the first three months of 2022.\"We always knew crypto would be volatile, but that volatility alongside larger economic factors may test the company, and us personally, in new ways,\" Brock wrote in Thursday's post. \"If we're flexible and resilient, and remain focused on the long term, Coinbase will come out stronger on the other side.\" WATCH: The 'Halftime Report' investment committee weigh in on fintechwatch nowVIDEO4:4904:49There are way too many publicly-traded fintechs, says Ritholtz CEO Josh BrownHalftime Report] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO8:3308:33How Terra's failed stablecoin could lead to a host of legal problemsCrypto WorldU.S. prosecutors are now going after insider trading in the crypto industry.On Wednesday, prosecutors in New York's Southern District charged and arrested Nathaniel Chastain, a former product manager at the online marketplace OpenSea. The 31-year-old faces one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, in connection with a scheme to commit insider trading in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, \"using confidential information about what NFTs were going to be featured on OpenSea's homepage for his personal financial gain.\"Each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, the Department of Justice wrote in a press release. DOJ officials say it is the first time they have pursued an insider trading charge involving digital assets.Chastain's alleged scheme was relatively simple.According to the indictment, Chastain was tasked with selecting NFTs to be featured on OpenSea's homepage. OpenSea kept those homepage selections confidential until they went live, since a main page listing often translated to a jump in price for both the featured NFT, as well as NFTs made by the same creator.From roughly June to September of 2021, the indictment says, Chastain would secretly buy an NFT just before OpenSea featured the piece on the front page of its website. Once those NFTs hit the main page, he would allegedly sell them \"at profits of two- to five-times his initial purchase price.\"To cover his tracks, he conducted transactions with anonymous digital currency wallets and anonymous accounts on OpenSea, according to the DOJ, which alleges this happened dozens of times.\"NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not,\" said U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. \"Today's charges demonstrate the commitment of this Office to stamping out insider trading — whether it occurs on the stock market or the blockchain.\"The FBI's Assistant Director-in-Charge Michael J. Driscoll says the bureau will continue to aggressively pursue actors who choose to manipulate the market in this way.Up until Sept. 2021, when Chastain's alleged bad practices first came to light, the start-up was relatively lax with respect to restrictions around employees using privileged information to invest in NFTs.The company has since implemented two new employee policies, including banning OpenSea team members from buying or selling from collections or creators while they are being featured or promoted by the company, as well as barring staff from \"using confidential information to purchase or sell any NFTs, whether available on the OpenSea platform or not.\" The entire episode lays bare the regulatory gap that exists across large swaths of the wider crypto ecosystem. NFTs, in particular, exist in a legal gray zone. They aren't officially considered securities, nor is there much by way of legal precedent around digital assets as a whole. So up until today's arrest, it wasn't clear if prosecutors would go after insider trading of NFTs.London-based fintech data analyst Boaz Sobrado said the OpenSea scandal makes two things clear. First, the transparency of the blockchain makes it a powerful tool to monitor nefarious behavior, given that all trades are public and recorded forever. But until today's arrest, regulators hadn't done much with that information.\"There's a lot of chat about regulation right now, but what a lot of these bad actors are doing is clearly against the law right now. Regulators don't need their powers expanded to be able to combat this sort of fraud and misleading statements,\" Sobrado said.Sobrado noted that money is so loose in the space that people participating in nefarious activity are neglecting the simplest steps to cover their tracks.\"This, again, is indicative of the sort of wanton craziness that is going on in the sector right now,\" he said. \"While the going is good and everyone feels like they're rich, it's not spoken about as much. But as soon as the market turns down, a lot of these people are going to get exposed and a lot of people are going to be angry.\"watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast Money] \n",

      "capsula.title Biden White House just put out a framework on regulating crypto — here’s what’s in it \n",
      "\n",
      "capsula.article_text [U.S. President Joe Biden walks from Marine One to the White House following a trip from Michigan, in Washington, U.S., September 14, 2022. Tom Brenner | ReutersThe Biden White House has just released its first-ever framework on what crypto regulation in the U.S. should look like — including ways in which the financial services industry should evolve to make borderless transactions easier, and how to crack down on fraud in the digital asset space.The new directives tap the muscle of existing regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, but nobody's mandating anything yet. The long-awaited direction from Washington has, however, captured the attention of both the crypto industry as a whole — and of investors in this nascent asset class.The framework follows an executive order issued in March, in which President Joe Biden called on federal agencies to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies and issue official reports on their findings.For six months, government agencies have been working to develop their own frameworks and policy recommendations to address half a dozen priorities listed in the executive order: consumer and investor protection; promoting financial stability; countering illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion; and responsible innovation. Together, these recommendations comprise the first, \"whole-of-government approach\" to regulating the industry.Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, and national security advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that the new guidelines are meant to position the country as a leader in governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad.Here are some of the key takeaways from the White House's new crypto framework.Fighting illicit financeOne section of the White House's new framework on crypto regulation focuses on eliminating illegal activity in the industry — and the measures proposed appear to have real teeth.\"The President will evaluate whether to call upon Congress to amend the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-tip-off statutes, and laws against unlicensed money transmitting to apply explicitly to digital asset service providers — including digital asset exchanges and nonfungible token (NFT) platforms,\" according to a White House fact sheet.Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it. This time the Fed's steering the shipApple may be seeing a demand split for iPhone 14 models, Bank of America saysMorgan Stanley says this EV battery maker can rally as much as 350%The president is also looking into whether to push Congress to raise the penalties for unlicensed money transmitting, as well as potentially amending certain federal statutes to allow the Department of Justice to prosecute digital asset crimes in any jurisdiction where a victim of those crimes is found.In terms of next steps, \"Treasury will complete an illicit finance risk assessment on decentralized finance by the end of February 2023 and an assessment on non-fungible tokens by July 2023,\" reads the fact sheet.Crime is rife in the digital asset sector. More than $1 billion in crypto has been lost to fraud since the start of 2021, according to research from the Federal Trade Commission.Last month, the SEC said it charged 11 people for their roles in creating and promoting a fraudulent crypto pyramid and Ponzi scheme that raised more than $300 million from millions of retail investors worldwide, including in the United States. Meanwhile, in February, U.S. officials seized $3.6 billion worth of bitcoin — their biggest seizure of cryptocurrencies ever — related to the 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex.watch nowVIDEO1:3901:39Here's why Fed Chair Jerome Powell wants stablecoin regulationCryptoA new kind of digital dollarThe framework also points to the potential for \"significant benefits\" from a U.S. central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which you can think of as a digital form of the U.S. dollar.Right now, there are several different types of digital U.S. dollars.Sitting in commercial bank accounts across the country are electronic U.S. dollars, which are partially backed by reserves, under a system known as fractional-reserve banking. As the name implies, the bank holds in its reserves a fraction of the bank's deposit liabilities. Transferring this form of money from one bank to another or from one country to another operates on legacy financial rails.There are also a spate of USD-pegged stablecoins, including Tether and USD Coin. Although critics have questioned whether tether has enough dollar reserves to back its currency, it remains the largest stablecoin on the planet. USD Coin is backed by fully reserved assets, redeemable on a 1:1 basis for U.S. dollars, and governed by Centre, a consortium of regulated financial institutions. It is also relatively easy to use no matter where you are.Then there's the hypothetical digital dollar that would be the Federal Reserve's take on a CBDC. This would essentially just be a digital twin of the U.S. dollar: Fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank.\"A dollar in CBDC form is a liability of the central bank. The Federal Reserve has to pay you back,\" said Ronit Ghose, who heads fintech and digital assets at Citi Global Insights.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell previously said the main incentive for the U.S. to launch its own central bank digital currency would be to eliminate the use case for crypto coins in America.\"You wouldn't need stablecoins; you wouldn't need cryptocurrencies, if you had a digital U.S. currency,\" Powell said. \"I think that's one of the stronger arguments in its favor.\"In the White House's new framework, it points to the fact that a U.S. CBDC could enable a payment system that is \"more efficient, provides a foundation for further technological innovation, facilitates faster cross-border transactions, and is environmentally sustainable.\"\"It could promote financial inclusion and equity by enabling access for a broad set of consumers,\" continues the report.To that end, the administration urges the Fed to continue its ongoing research, experimentation and evaluation of a CBDC.watch nowVIDEO7:4907:49Sen. Lummis on Crypto Oversight Bill, and why stablecoins need to be backed by hard assetsCrypto WorldSafeguarding financial stabilityCentral bankers and U.S. lawmakers have for years bemoaned the rise of stablecoins, a specific subset of cryptocurrencies that have a value pegged to a real-world asset, such as a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or a commodity like gold.These nongovernmental digital tokens are increasingly being used in domestic and international transactions, which is scary for central banks because they don't have a say in how this space is regulated.In May, the collapse of TerraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin projects, cost investors tens of billions of dollars as they pulled out in a panic that some have compared to a bank run. Widespread buy-in — and public PSAs — from respected financial institutions lent credibility to the project, further driving the narrative that the whole thing was legit.The implosion of this stablecoin project led to a series of insolvencies that erased nearly $600 billion in wealth, according to the White House.\"Digital assets and the mainstream financial system are becoming increasingly intertwined, creating channels for turmoil to have spillover effects,\" according to the White House fact sheet.The framework goes on to single out stablecoins, warning that they could create disruptive runs if not paired with appropriate regulation.To make stablecoins \"safer,\" the administration says the Treasury will \"work with financial institutions to bolster their capacity to identify and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities by sharing information and promoting a wide range of data sets and analytical tools,\" as well as team up with other agencies to \"identify, track, and analyze emerging strategic risks that relate to digital asset markets.\"Those efforts will also happen in concert with international allies, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Financial Stability Board.watch nowVIDEO6:4706:47Two crypto experts say the Ethereum network merge is criticalWorldwide Exchange] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty ImagesCarnage in the crypto market won't let up, as token prices plummet, companies lay off employees in waves, and some of the most popular names in the industry go belly up. The chaos has spooked investors, erasing more than $2 trillion in value in a matter of months — and wiping out the life savings of retail traders who bet big on crypto projects billed as safe investments.The sudden drop in wealth has stoked fears that the crypto crash might help trigger a broader recession.The crypto market's sub $1 trillion market cap (which is less than half that of Apple's) is tiny compared to the country's $21 trillion GDP or $43 trillion housing market. But U.S. households own one-third of the global crypto market, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs, and a Pew Research Center survey also found that 16% of U.S. adults said they had invested in, traded, or used a cryptocurrency. So there is some degree of national exposure to the deep-sell off in the crypto market.Then there's the whole mystique around the nascent crypto sector. It may be among the smaller asset classes, but the buzzy industry commands a lot of attention in popular culture, with ads on major sporting championships and stadium sponsorships.That said, economists and bankers tell CNBC they aren't worried about a knock-on effect from crypto to the broader U.S. economy for one big reason: Crypto is not tied to debt.\"People don't really use crypto as collateral for real-world debts. Without that, this is just a lot of paper losses. So this is low on the list of issues for the economy,\" said Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Toronto.Gans says that's a big part of why the crypto market is still more of a \"side show\" for the economy.No debt, no problemThe relationship between cryptocurrencies and debt is key.For most traditional asset classes, their value is expected to stay moderately stable over some period of time. That is why those owned assets can then be used as collateral to borrow money.\"What you haven't seen with crypto assets, simply because of their volatility, is that same process by which you're able to use it to buy other real world assets or more traditional financial assets and borrow off that basis,\" explained Gans.Read more about tech and crypto from CNBC ProCrypto’s bear market is unlike others before it. This time the Fed's steering the shipApple may be seeing a demand split for iPhone 14 models, Bank of America saysMorgan Stanley says this EV battery maker can rally as much as 350%\"People have used cryptocurrency to borrow for other cryptocurrency, but that's sort of contained in the crypto world.\"There are exceptions — MicroStrategy took out a $205 million bitcoin-backed loan in March with the crypto-focused bank Silvergate — but for the most part, crypto-backed loans exist within an industry-specific echo chamber.According to a recent research note from Morgan Stanley, crypto lenders have mostly been loaning to crypto investors and companies. The spillover risks from tanking crypto prices to the broader fiat U.S. dollar banking system, therefore, \"may be limited.\"For all the enthusiasm for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, venture capitalist and celebrity investor Kevin O'Leary points out that most digital asset holdings are not institutional.Gans agrees, telling CNBC that he doubts banks are all that exposed to the crypto sell-off.\"There's certainly been banks and other financial institutions, which have expressed interest in crypto as an asset and as an asset that they might like their customers to also be able to invest in, but in reality, there isn't that much of that investment going on,\" explained Gans, noting that banks have their own set of regulations and their own need to make sure that things are appropriate investments.\"I don't think we've seen the sort of exposure to that that we've seen in other financial crises,\" he said.watch nowVIDEO12:1112:11Kevin O'Leary on why the crash could benefit crypto businesses in the long termCrypto WorldLimited exposureExperts tell CNBC that the exposure of everyday mom and pop investors in the U.S. isn't all that high. Even though some retail traders have been battered by the recent stretch of liquidations, overall losses in the crypto market are small relative to the $150 trillion net worth of U.S. households.According to a note from Goldman Sachs in May, crypto holdings comprise only 0.3% of household worth in the U.S., compared with 33% tied up in equities. The firm expects the drag on aggregate spending from the recent price declines to \"be very small.\"O'Leary, who has said that 20% of his portfolio is in crypto, also makes the point that these losses are spread out worldwide.\"The great news about the crypto economy and even positions like bitcoin or ethereum, these are decentralized holdings. It's not just the American investor exposed,\" he said. \"If bitcoin went down another 20%, it wouldn't really matter because it's spread around everywhere.\"\"And it's only $880 billion before the correction, which is a big nothing burger,\" continued O'Leary.By way of comparison, BlackRock has $10 trillion in assets under management, and the market value of the four most valuable tech companies — even after this year's correction — is still over $5 trillion.If bitcoin went down another 20%, it wouldn't really matter because it's spread around everywhereKevin O'LearyVenture CapitalistSome analysts on Wall Street even believe the fallout of failed crypto projects are a good thing for the sector overall — a sort of stress test to wash out the obvious business model flaws.\"The collapse of weaker business models such as TerraUSD and Luna is likely healthy for the long term health of this sector,\" said Alkesh Shah, global crypto and digital asset strategist at Bank of America.Shah says the weakness in the crypto and digital assets sector is part of the broader risk asset correction. Rather than driving the economy down, crypto prices are tracking tech equities lower, as both succumb to pressure from greater macroeconomic forces, including spiraling inflation and a seemingly endless succession of Fed rate hikes.\"Higher than expected rate hikes coupled with recession risk has broadly hit risk assets including software and crypto/digital assets. With central banks globally tightening, my strategy colleagues expect central banks to take about $3 trillion of liquidity from markets globally,\" continued Shah.Mati Greenspan, the CEO of crypto research and investment firm Quantum Economics, blames the Fed's tightening as well.\"Central banks were very quick to print gobs of money when it wasn't needed, which led to excessive risk taking and reckless build up of leverage in the system. Now that they're withdrawing the liquidity, the entire world is feeling the pinch.\"watch nowVIDEO4:3704:37Why anonymity is 'not plausible' when using a central bank digital currencyCrypto World] \n",

      "\n",
      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO2:4202:42Why the collapse of Celsius may not be a total shock, but is still putting a chill over the entire crypto marketWorldwide ExchangeCelsius filing for bankruptcy this week surprised virtually no one. Once a platform freezes customer assets, it's typically all over. But even though it was expected, it remains a really big deal for the industry.In October 2021, CEO Alex Mashinsky said the crypto lender had $25 billion in assets under management. Even as recently as May — despite crashing cryptocurrency prices — the lender was managing about $11.8 billion in assets, according to its website. The firm had another $8 billion in client loans, making it one of the world's biggest names in crypto lending.Now, Celsius is down to $167 million \"in cash on hand,\" which it says will provide \"ample liquidity\" to support operations during the restructuring process.Meanwhile, Celsius owes its users around $4.7 billion, according to its bankruptcy filing — and there's an approximate $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.It goes to show that leverage is one hell of a drug, but the moment you suck out all that liquidity, it's a whole lot harder to keep the party going.The fall of Celsius marks the third major bankruptcy in the crypto ecosystem in two weeks, and it is being billed as crypto's Lehman Brothers moment — comparing the contagion effect of a failed crypto lender to the fall of a major Wall Street bank that ultimately foretold the 2008 mortgage debt and financial crisis.Regardless of whether the Celsius implosion portends a larger collapse of the greater crypto ecosystem, the days of customers collecting double-digit annual returns are over. For Celsius, promising those big yields as a means to onboard new users is a big part of what led to its ultimate downfall.\"They were subsidizing it and taking losses to get clients in the door,\" said Castle Island Venture's Nic Carter. \"The yields on the other end were fake and subsidized. Basically, they were pulling through returns from [Ponzi schemes].\"watch nowVIDEO3:1003:10Can platforms with weak business models survive crypto contagion?Power LunchWho will get their money backThree weeks after Celsius halted all withdrawals due to \"extreme market conditions\" — and a few days before the crypto lender ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection — the platform was still advertising in big bold text on its website annual returns of nearly 19%, which paid out weekly.\"Transfer your crypto to Celsius and you could be earning up to 18.63% APY in minutes,\" read the website on July 3.Promises such as these helped to rapidly lure in new users. Celsius said it had 1.7 million customers, as of June.The company's bankruptcy filing shows that Celsius also has more than 100,000 creditors, some of whom lent the platform cash without any collateral to back up the arrangement. The list of its top 50 unsecured creditors, includes Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm Alameda Research, as well as an investment firm based in the Cayman Islands.Those creditors are likely first in line to get their money back, should there be anything for the taking — with mom and pop investors left holding the bag.After filing its bankruptcy petition, Celsius clarified that \"most account activity will be paused until further notice\" and that it was \"not requesting authority to allow customer withdrawals at this time.\"The FAQ goes on to say that reward accruals are also halted through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, and customers will not be receiving reward distributions at this time.That means customers trying to access their crypto cash are out of luck for now. It is also unclear whether bankruptcy proceedings will ultimately enable customers to ever recoup their losses. If there is some sort of payout at the end of what could be a multi-year process, there is also the question of who would be first in line to get it.Unlike the traditional banking system, which typically insures customer deposits, there aren't formal consumer protections in place to safeguard user funds when things go wrong. Celsius spells out in its terms and conditions that any digital asset transferred to the platform constitutes a loan from the user to Celsius. Because there was no collateral put up by Celsius, customer funds were essentially just unsecured loans to the platform.Also in the fine print of Celsius' terms and conditions is a warning that in the event of bankruptcy, \"any Eligible Digital Assets used in the Earn Service or as collateral under the Borrow Service may not be recoverable\" and that customers \"may not have any legal remedies or rights in connection with Celsius' obligations.\" The disclosure reads like an attempt at blanket immunity from legal wrongdoing, should things ever go south.Another popular lending platform catering to retail investors with high-yield offerings is Voyager Digital, which has 3.5 million customers and recently filed for bankruptcy, as well.To reassure their millions of users, Voyager CEO Stephen Ehrlich tweeted that after the company goes through bankruptcy proceedings, users with crypto in their account would potentially be eligible for a sort of grab bag of stuff, including a combination of the crypto in their account, common shares in the reorganized Voyager, Voyager tokens, and then whatever proceeds they are able to get from the company's now-defunct loan to the once prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.It is unclear what the Voyager token would actually be worth, or whether any of this will come together in the end.Three Arrows Capital is the third major crypto player seeking bankruptcy protection in a U.S. federal courtroom, in a trend that can't help beg the question: Will bankruptcy court ultimately be the place where new precedent in the crypto sector is set, in a sort of regulate-by-ruling model?Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are already looking to establish more ground rules.Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., are aiming to provide clarity with a bill that lays out a comprehensive framework for regulating the crypto industry and divvies up oversight among regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.watch nowVIDEO3:5003:50Crypto bankruptcies spread through digital asset landscape as cheap money dries upTechCheckWhat went wrongCelsius' overarching problem is that the nearly 20% APY it was offering to customers wasn't real.In one lawsuit, Celsius is being accused of operating a Ponzi scheme, in which it paid early depositors with the money it got from new users.Celsius also invested its funds in other platforms offering similarly sky-high returns, in order to keep its business model afloat.A report from The Block found that Celsius had at least half a billion dollars invested in Anchor, which was the flagship lending platform of the now failed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project terraUSD (UST). Anchor promised investors a 20% annual percentage yield on their UST holdings — a rate many analysts said was unsustainable.Celsius was one of multiple platforms to park its cash with Anchor, which is a big part of why the cascade of major failures was so significant and swift after the UST project imploded in May.\"They always have to source yield, so they move the assets around into risky instruments that are impossible to hedge,\" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer and adjunct professor of finance at the University of Southern California.As for the $1.2 billion gap in its balance sheet, Bhatia chalks it up to poor risk models and the fact that collateral was sold out from under it by institutional lenders.\"They probably lost customer deposits in UST,\" Bhatia added. \"When the assets go down in price, that's how you get a 'hole.' The liability remains, so again, poor risk models.\"Celsius isn't alone. Cracks keep forming in the lending corner of the crypto market. Castle Island Venture's Carter says the net effect of all this is that credit is being destroyed and withdrawn, underwriting standards are being tightened, and solvency is being tested, so everyone is withdrawing liquidity from crypto lenders.\"This has the effect of driving up yields, as credit gets more scarce,\" said Carter, who noted that we're already seeing this happen.Carter expects to see a general inflationary deleveraging in the U.S. and elsewhere, which he says only further makes the case for stablecoins, as relatively hard money, and bitcoin, as truly hard money.\"But the portion of the industry that relies on the issuance of frivolous tokens will be forced to change,\" he said. \"So I expect the result to be heterogeneous across the crypto space, depending on the specific sector.\"watch nowVIDEO10:0810:08Ether rallies, OpenSea cuts jobs by 20%, and why USDC is gaining ground on USDT: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World] \n",

FTX is expected to pay roughly $25 million, one source said, 99% below BlockFi's last private valuation. Another person with direct knowledge of the deal pegged the price closer to $50 million. Jersey City, New Jersey-based BlockFi was last valued at $4.8 billion, according to PitchBook. The price tag could shift between now and Friday, the source said. An acquisition could also take multiple months to close. The person added that the deal could end up being options to acquire BlockFi at a later date, pending regulatory approval.Friday also marks the end of the quarter, which one source said was a catalyst for getting a deal signed. The Wall Street Journal first reported that FTX was seeking an equity stake in the company, while The Block reported this week that an outright deal was in the works. An FTX spokesperson said the company \"would not be commenting on the matter.\" A BlockFi spokesperson said the company \"does not comment on market rumors.\" BlockFi CEO Zac Prince pushed back on the $25 million figure in a tweet calling the figure \"market rumors.\"The fire sale comes a week after FTX provided a $250 million emergency line of credit to BlockFi. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said at the time that the financing would help BlockFi \"navigate the market from a position of strength.\" watch nowVIDEO2:3202:32FTX closes in on deal to buy BlockFiThe ExchangeIt's the latest fallout for crypto lending companies amid plunging crypto asset prices. Funds have struggled with liquidity issues as counterparties fail to meet margin calls. Celsius and CoinFlex paused customer withdrawals citing \"extreme market conditions.\" Major cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has fallen into liquidation, CNBC reported earlier, marking one of the biggest casualties of crypto's bear market.Another source said equity investors in BlockFi are \"wiped out\" and are now writing off the value of their losses. The person said multiple offers were being considered, since there was no \"shop clause\" in the term sheet. \"There was more than one deal on the table,\" a source told CNBC. Billionaire Bankman-Fried has been seen as a lender of last resort in the space. In addition to BlockFi, Bankman-Fried's company Alameda Research provided a $500 million loan to Voyager.Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO7:3507:35DeFi presents an incredible opportunity for long-term investors, says Bitwise CIO Matt HouganCrypto WorldBitcoin just finished its worst month on record, losing more than 38% of its value in June, as of Thursday afternoon. Ether, the world's second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ended the same period down by about 47%.Though weakness in the digital assets sector is part of a broader flight from risk, confidence in the crypto market, in particular, has been rocked in recent weeks as major companies face solvency crises.In May, the popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin project UST — and its sister token luna — imploded, tallying a $60 billion collective loss. Then in early June, lending firm Celsius, which promised users high yields for their digital currency deposits, paused withdrawals for customers, citing \"extreme market conditions.\"Elsewhere, prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million on Monday. And on Thursday, sources told CNBC that FTX plans to buy crypto lender BlockFi for $25 million. That's 99% below BlockFi's last private valuation, effectively \"wiping out\" the company's equity investors, according to one source.All this comes amid industrywide layoffs at major crypto firms, including Coinbase, whose stock fell about 40% in June, marking its fourth straight negative month.\"There is still an aspect in crypto that we are waiting to see if another shoe will drop, if another entity will fail, if the credit cascade will continue,\" said Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, in an interview. \"I think we have to get through the Fourth of July weekend and get through that quiet period in the market before we build in the second half of the year.\"To some degree, extreme volatility is the price of doing business in the digital asset market. In the last decade, bitcoin has experienced two prolonged periods of depressed prices before it rebounded. In the previous crypto winter in 2018, bitcoin lost more than 80% of its value before bouncing back, eventually rising to its November 2021 peak of around $69,000.But a note from Bank of America on Wednesday struck a pessimistic tone. Analysts pointed to data indicating that U.S. consumers are more wary of the crypto market. Internal customer data shows a more than 50% decline in the number of active crypto users from its peak of over 1 million users in November 2021 to less than 500,000 in May, the bank said.The drop in June was the worst for the cryptocurrency since it was first made available on exchanges in 2010. More than $2 trillion in value has been erased from the crypto markets in a matter of months, punishing retail traders who bet big on crypto projects that were billed as safe investments.The crypto market's sub-$1 trillion market cap is tiny compared to the country's $21 trillion GDP or $43 trillion housing market. But U.S. households own one-third of the global crypto market, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs. A Pew Research Center survey also found that 16% of U.S. adults said they had invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency.Still, many bitcoin enthusiasts expect another revival, and are buying at what they anticipate will be record lows. Michael Saylor tweeted on Wednesday that MicroStrategy snapped up an additional 480 bitcoin for about $10 million, bringing the company's total holdings of the world's most popular digital coin to around $4 billion.\"If your timeframe is a week, or a month, or even a quarter, I think there's still significant volatility,\" said Hougan. \"If you have a time horizon measured in years, then yes, this is a great opportunity to think about entering the market.\"WATCH: Bitcoin fell 30% in a week.

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast MoneyWASHINGTON — In May, the collapse of one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin projects cost investors tens of billions of dollars as they pulled out in a panic that some have compared to a bank run. But before that, the stablecoin known as terraUSD (or UST, for short) and its sister token luna, had experienced a pretty spectacular run-up — and some investors made a killing before it all collapsed.Venture capital firm Pantera Capital tells CNBC it earned a 100-fold return on its $1.7 million investment in luna. Hack VC and the Winklevoss-backed CMCC Global didn't share their exact gains, but CMCC told CNBC that it closed its luna position in March, while Hack reportedly got out in December.The scheme relied largely on faith and the promise of future returns, plus a complex set of code, with very little hard cash to back up the whole arrangement.Unlike USDC (another popular dollar-pegged stablecoin), which has fiat assets in reserve as a way to back their tokens, UST was an algorithmic stablecoin created and administered by Singapore-based Terraform Labs. It depended on computer code to self-stabilize its value by creating and destroying UST and luna in a sort of supply-and-demand seesaw effect.For a while, it worked.UST held its dollar peg and the luna token soared. The luna token rose to more than $116 in April, up more than 135% in less than two months. Traders were able to arbitrage the system and profit from deviations in the price of the two tokens. But perhaps the greatest incentive of the entire scheme was an accompanying lending platform, called Anchor, which promised investors a 20% annual percentage yield on their UST holdings — a rate many analysts said was unsustainable.Widespread buy-in — and public PSAs — from respected financial institutions lent credibility to the project, further driving the narrative that the whole thing was legit.Most everyone was happy until it all came crashing down in early May.watch nowVIDEO8:1808:18How a $60 billion crypto collapse got regulators worriedCryptoAlthough the project had amassed about $3 billion worth of bitcoin in its reserves as a backstop for UST, when the price of luna became unstable, investors rushed out of both tokens, sending prices off a cliff. The Luna Foundation Guard tried to restore UST's $1 peg by spending almost all of the bitcoin in its reserve. It didn't work.At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless.The entire episode has laid bare the advantages of experienced large-scale investors over retail investors gambling on hope.One person posted on Reddit that they didn't think they would have enough money to pay for their next semester at school after losing money on luna and UST. Another investor affected by the crash tweeted that she and her husband sold their house and bet it all on luna, noting that she was still trying to digest whether it was actually happening or just a nightmare.Others are contemplating suicide after losing all they've got.\"I'm lost, about to commit suicide in a chair,\" one commenter posted to Reddit. \"I lost my life savings in the investments of (LUNA UST) the worst thing is that 3 weeks ago I proposed to my girlfriend. She doesn't know anything, I lost 62 thousand dollars. I'm here I don't know what to do.\"watch nowVIDEO7:4907:49Sen. Lummis on Crypto Oversight Bill, and why stablecoins need to be backed by hard assetsCrypto WorldWho cashed out, and whyAmong the winners of the UST flash crash are Pantera Capital, a hedge fund that saw a 100x return on its investment.Joey Krug, the fund's co-chief investment officer, told CNBC that in the primary fund where they held and traded luna, they sold about 87% of their position from Jan. 2021 through Apr. 2022. Pantera then sold another 8% in May once it was clear the UST peg had broken. At the end of it all, Krug says that Pantera \"got stuck\" with about 5% of their position.All that liquidation translated to a return of $171 million on a $1.7 million initial investment, assuming the remaining luna they own continue to be worth nothing.Even as the fund was selling, Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead joined CNBC in Dec. 2021 to talk about his top altcoin picks, which included the Terra blockchain's luna token. At the time, luna was up more than 15,800% in 2021.\"We think it's one of the most promising coins for the coming year,\" Morehead said of luna. \"So many people are just discovering it and just starting to trade it.\"But Krug says the firm's initial decision to liquidate came down to risk management and rebalancing the fund.\"For the large portion which we sold over 2021 and part of 2022, it was a really simple risk management reason,\" said Krug. \"It kept becoming a larger and larger part of the fund and so we had to de-risk it since you can't really run a liquid hedge fund with one position being a super large portion of the fund.\"When Pantera noticed the UST $1 peg breaking in May, it sold again.\"It was really just seeing the peg break by a few cents and pattern matching it to historical currency pegs,\" continued Krug, who noted that generally when a currency breaks peg, it gets hammered. Even though the firm owned a bunch of luna as opposed to UST, when UST trades under its peg, the dynamic is such that more luna is minted, lowering the value of each coin overall.\"So basically, you want to sell it so you don't end up getting diluted,\" explained Krug.Hong Kong-based venture firm CMCC Global was one of Terraform's first seed investors back in early 2018.CMCC Founder Martin Baumann tells CNBC it divested its stake in March because of concerns resulting from ongoing due diligence. The decision to sell was partly to do with the tech behind UST, but his chief concern had more to do with regulation.\"As opposed to asset backed stablecoins, which are derivatives of existing USD in circulation, UST was effectively increasing the money supply of USD in existence,\" a job that Baumann notes is reserved for the Federal Reserve.\"We figured, while an interesting concept, regulators would not tolerate tampering with money supply of the USD,\" continued Baumann.The rapid growth of UST accelerated CMCC's concerns.When CMCC sold, the luna token was trading at about $100. When asked about the profit on that sale, Baumann said the firm does not comment on returns or performance of individual investments.Crypto-centric venture fund Hack VC reportedly exited its Luna stake in December.CNBC reached out to Hack VC partner Rodney Yesep, but he didn't respond to our request for comment on the profitability of that sale. Yesep did say in a recent interview on the DeFi Decoded Podcast that they were seed investors in Terra from \"back in the day\" when it was \"like a different entity.\"\"It sucks to see a bunch of people get impacted by this sort of stuff,\" Yesep said in the podcast. \"We were no longer holding a position by the time the downturn happened, but a lot of people were, and a lot of people were pretty impacted.\"Then there's Galaxy Digital, the crypto merchant bank founded by billionaire investor Mike Novogratz.In a public letter addressed to \"shareholders, friends, partners, and the crypto community,\" Novogratz — who got a luna tattoo on his arm to memorialize his status as an official 'Lunatic' — opined on where the project went wrong, but also noted that Galaxy took profits along the way.In its Q1 earnings filing, Galaxy noted that the largest contributor to its net realized gain on digital assets of $355 million was sales of luna.Other major backers of Terraform Labs included some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coinbase Ventures. Three Arrows Capital and Jump Crypto bought into the luna token. CNBC has not learned how these firms fared.watch nowVIDEO2:5302:53Sen. Cynthia Lummis and DC regulators weigh in stablecoin chaos and how to police cryptoCrypto WorldA road to redemption?Terra's backers have voted to revive the failed venture. The proposed re-build involves a new Terra blockchain and getting rid of the beleaguered stablecoin that helped trigger the meltdown of the original project. It could also mean redemption for the institutional and retail investors who got wiped out.For those who saw a big loss, the re-launch could potentially translate into an opportunity to recoup losses on initial investments.Delphi Digital, for example, has disclosed that it it is \"currently sitting on a large unrealized loss\" after miscalculating the risk of a death spiral event coming to fruition, and Coindesk reporting shows that Seoul-based Hashed Ventures has lost over $3.5 billion.The terra 2.0 proposal includes a plan to distribute tokens to holders of the old luna (soon to be renamed \"luna classic\") and UST tokens. If the rebranded coins take off, that could be a form of redemption for investors who suffered a loss.But for those who got out before things went south for UST, they are steering clear.\"With the new chain, it looks like a good chunk of the airdropped tokens will be vested over a number of years,\" Pantera Capital's Krug told CNBC. \"We have projects in our portfolio which have integrations with Terra. I'd love to see something community driven succeed here, but we're a fairly chain-agnostic fund.\"CMCC Global's Baumann said the fund has decided not to make new investments into the revived terra ecosystem at this time.Days before the UST collapse, Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon — who has bragged that he doesn't \"debate the poor\" — said in an interview that 95% of coins would \"die\" but there is \"entertainment in watching companies die, too.\"watch nowVIDEO10:1410:14Terra's epic collapse, explained, and why crypto may see wild swings this weekend: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [In this articleETH=Follow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTwatch nowVIDEO2:5302:53Sen. Cynthia Lummis and DC regulators weigh in stablecoin chaos and how to police cryptoCrypto WorldWASHINGTON — It's been a brutal few weeks for the crypto market.Half a trillion dollars was wiped off the sector's market cap as terraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, imploded virtually overnight.Meanwhile, digital coins such as ether continue to take a beating on the price charts, as the sell-off keeps hammering the industry.Some investors have called the events of the last month a Bear Stearns moment for crypto, comparing the contagion effect of a failed stablecoin project to the fall of a major Wall Street bank that ultimately foretold the 2008 mortgage debt and financial crisis.\"It really revealed some deeper vulnerabilities in the system,\" said Michael Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency for the U.S. Treasury Department.\"Clearly, you saw contagion, not just from terra to the broader crypto ecosystem, but to tether, to other stablecoins, and I think that's something that wasn't assumed. And I think that's something people have to really pay attention to.\"But so far, government officials don't seem to be worried about a crypto crash taking down the broader economy.Several senators and regulators told CNBC on the sidelines of the DC Blockchain Summit this week that the spillover effects are contained, crypto investors shouldn't freak out, U.S. regulation is the key to success for cryptocurrencies, and crucially, the crypto asset class isn't going anywhere.\"There need to be rules to this game that make it more predictable, transparent, where there are the needed consumer protections,\" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ.\"What we don't want to do is choke a new industry and innovation out so that we lose out on opportunities. Or what I'm seeing right now, a lot of these opportunities just move offshore, and we're missing the economic growth and job creation that's a part of it. So this is a really important space if we get the regulation right, that can actually be helpful to the industry and protecting consumers,\" continued Booker.watch nowVIDEO1:3401:34UST's crash has some investors re-evaluating their crypto investmentsFast MoneyA contained eventIn early May, a popular stablecoin known as terraUSD, or UST, plummeted in value, in what some have described as a \"bank run,\" as investors rushed to pull out their money. At their height, luna and UST had a combined market value of almost $60 billion. Now, they're essentially worthless.Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tethered to the price of a real-world asset, such as the U.S. dollar. UST is a specific breed, known as an \"algorithmic\" stablecoin. Unlike USDC (another popular dollar-pegged stablecoin), which has fiat assets in reserve as a way to back their tokens, UST depended on computer code to self-stabilize its value.UST stabilized prices at close to $1 by linking it to a sister token called luna through computer code running on the blockchain — essentially, investors could \"destroy\" one coin to help stabilize the price of the other. Both coins were issued by an organization called Terraform Labs, and developers used the underlying system to create other applications such as NFTs and decentralized finance apps.When the price of luna became unstable, investors rushed out of both tokens, sending prices crashing.UST's failure, though infectious, wasn't much of a surprise to some crypto insiders.Coin Metrics' Nic Carter tells CNBC that no algorithmic stablecoin has ever succeeded, noting that the fundamental problem with UST was that it was largely backed by faith in the issuer.Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who is among the most progressive lawmakers on Capitol Hill when it comes to crypto, agrees with Carter.\"There are a couple types of stablecoins. The one that failed is an algorithmic stablecoin, very different from an asset-backed stablecoin,\" Lummis told CNBC. She said she hoped consumers could see that not all stablecoins are made equal and that choosing an asset-backed stablecoin is essential.That sentiment was echoed by the managing director of the International Monetary Fund at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.\"I would beg you not to pull out of the importance of this world,\" said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva. \"It offers us all faster service, much lower costs, and more inclusion, but only if we separate apples from oranges and bananas.\"Georgieva also stressed that stablecoins not backed by assets to support them are a pyramid scheme and emphasized that the responsibility falls to regulators to put up protective guardrails for investors.  \"I think it is likely that we're going to have regulation happen faster because of the events of recent weeks,\" said Securities and Exchange Commission's Hester Peirce, who also noted that stablecoin legislation was already on the docket before the fall of UST.\"We have to make sure to...preserve the ability of people to experiment with different models, and do so in a way that fits within regulatory guardrails,\" continued the SEC Commissioner.watch nowVIDEO3:1603:16US comptroller Michael Hsu on potential crypto regulation in the fallout of Terra's stablecoin collapseCrypto WorldLegislating against shadow bankingFor Commissioner Caroline Pham of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the UST meltdown highlights just how much action regulators need to take to protect against a possible return of shadow banking — that is, a type of banking system in which financial activities are facilitated by unregulated intermediaries or under unregulated circumstances.Pham says a lot of existing safeguards could do the trick.\"It's always faster to stand up a regulatory framework when it's already existing,\" said Pham. \"You're just talking about extending the regulatory perimeter around newer, novel products.\"Months before the UST algorithmic stablecoin project failed, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets published a report outlining a regulatory framework for stablecoins. In it, the group divides the stablecoin landscape into two main camps: trading stablecoins and payment stablecoins.Today, stablecoins are typically used to facilitate trading of other digital assets. The report looks to set down best practices to regulate stablecoins to be more widely used as a means of payment.\"For those who are like me, bank regulators, we're kind-of historians of money-like instruments,\" said Hsu, whose Office of the Comptroller of the Currency co-authored the report.\"This is a really familiar story, and the way to deal with it is prudential regulation. This is why I think some of the options, the proposals for more of a bank kind of regulatory-type approach is a good starting point.\"The key question that regulators and lawmakers need to address is whether stablecoins, including the subset of algorithmic stablecoins, are in fact derivatives, says Pham.If people started to think about some of these really novel crypto tokens as frankly, lottery tickets. When you go and you buy a lottery ticket, you might strike it big, and get rich quick, but you might not.Caroline PhamCFTC commissionerGenerally speaking, a derivative is a financial instrument that allows people to trade on the price fluctuations of an underlying asset. The underlying asset can be almost anything, including commodities such as gold or — according to the way the SEC is currently thinking — a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.The SEC regulates securities, but for everything that is not a security, the CFTC probably has some regulatory touchpoint over it, says Pham.\"We have the regulation over derivatives based on commodities, but we also have certain areas ... where we directly regulate spot markets,\" said Pham.\"The last time we had ... something blow up like this in the financial crisis — risky, opaque, complex financial products — Congress came up with a solution for that, and that was with Dodd-Frank,\" continued Pham, referring to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010 in response to the Great Recession. The act included stricter regulation of derivatives, plus new restrictions related to the trading practices of FDIC-insured institutions.  \"If some of these trading stablecoins are, in fact, derivatives, basically, you're talking about a custom basket swap, and then it's the dealer who has to manage the risk associated with that,\" explained Pham.watch nowVIDEO8:1108:11CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham discusses Terra's collapse, crypto regulation, and executive ordersCrypto WorldCongress calls the shotsUltimately, SEC Commissioner Peirce says, Congress calls the shots on how to move forward on crypto regulation. While Wall Street's top regulator is already acting using the authority that it has, Congress needs to divvy up enforcement responsibilities.Lummis has paired up with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., to spell out this division of regulatory labor in a proposed bill.\"We're setting it on top of the current regulatory framework for assets, including the CFTC and the SEC,\" Lummis told CNBC. \"We're making sure that the taxation is capital gains and not ordinary income. We've dealt with some accounting procedures, some definitions, we're looking at consumer protection and privacy.\"The bill also delves into stablecoin regulation. Lummis says that the bill contemplates the existence of this specific subset of digital assets and requires that they either be FDIC-insured or more than 100% backed by hard assets.Booker says there is a group in the Senate with \"good folks on both sides of the aisle\" coming together and partnering to get it right.\"I want there to be the right regulation,\" continued Booker. \"I don't think the SEC is the place to regulate a lot of this industry. Clearly, ethereum and bitcoin, which are the majority of the cryptocurrencies, are more commodity-like.\"But until Capitol Hill pushes a bill into law, Pham says that crypto investors need to exercise a whole lot more caution.\"If people started to think about some of these really novel crypto tokens as frankly, lottery tickets, when you go and you buy a lottery ticket, you might strike it big, and get rich quick, but you might not,\" said Pham.\"I think what I'm worried about is that without appropriate customer protections in place, and the right disclosures, that people are buying some of these crypto tokens thinking that they're guaranteed to strike it rich,\" she said.watch nowVIDEO7:4907:49Sen.

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO5:5805:58FTX U.S. president Brett Harrison on why the crypto exchange is launching stock tradingCrypto WorldThe U.S. affiliate of crypto exchange FTX is rolling out zero-commission stock trading as part of a bigger bet that retail investors will want to see their crypto and stock investments in a single place.FTX U.S. will offer no-fee brokerage accounts, commission-free trading, and market and company data, the company announced Thursday. For now, the new service is limited to a small number of U.S. users.As people become more familiar with cryptocurrencies as investment assets, and as investing services become more easily accessible to a growing number of retail investors, FTX is counting on users growing weary of managing various apps and accounts for their financial activity, according to FTX U.S. President Brett Harrison. The company is hoping to become a one-stop shop for retail investors, he said.\"If they want to invest in stocks, they're not going to want to have to split their savings between two different apps, or have to move money around between two different accounts,\" Harrison told CNBC's \"Crypto World\" on Thursday. \"They'd like to be able to have one holistic experience where they can invest in multiple asset classes from a single app and experience. That's what we're hoping to provide by combining stocks and crypto into the same application for our user,\" he said.The product, called FTX Stocks, will initially route orders to Nasdaq through its clearing firm, Embed, Harrison said, adding the company will not receive any payment for order flow, citing \"a growing retail concern around transparency and fairness around order routing.\" The back-end payments that brokers receive for directing clients' trades to market makers came under scrutiny last year during the Robinhood-GameStop trading frenzy, which brought more retail investors into the market.Instead, FTX Stocks is more of a customer-acquisition play, Harrison said. While FTX U.S. may initially lose money on stock trades, it hopes to recoup those losses in other ways, including through its crypto-trading service and selling its basic crypto services to other brokers and financial services providers.\"To start, this isn't going to be a profitable endeavor for us,\" Harrison said. \"Our goal is to be able to add this additional service for our customers to help bolster our existing business.\"Customers will have the option to fund their accounts with fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC in addition to normal dollar deposits through wire transfer, ACH or credit card. There will be no minimum required balances for customers to maintain and users will be able to trade some securities fractionally.The news, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes as the S&P 500 teeters on the edge of a bear market. Stocks — and cryptocurrencies — have been in a brutal sell-off for most of this year. The Nasdaq Composite suffered its worst month in April since 2008.FTX U.S. made the announcement a week after the company's owner, Sam Bankman-Fried, bought a minority stake in Robinhood, making him the third-largest shareholder and fueling speculation that he's interested in acquiring the whole company. Shares of Robinhood, which got its start in stock trading and has seen strong customer demand for crypto, have been falling and last week hit an all-time low, about 77% below its July 2021 IPO price.This week, Robinhood revealed plans for its own bigger push into crypto.FTX U.S. also joins fintech brands like Block's Cash App, SoFi and Public in offering trading in both stocks and crypto. Big crypto rivals like Coinbase and Binance do not offer stock trading, with the latter ending its equities product last year.watch nowVIDEO8:5308:53Bitcoin crosses $30,000, Ethereum preps upgrade and FTX U.S. launches stock trading: CNBC Crypto WorldCrypto World] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [The logo of cryptocurrency platform BlockFi.Budrul Chukrut | SOPA Images | LightRocket via Getty ImagesCrypto lender BlockFi is cutting around 20% of its staff as the company reckons with a dramatic downturn in digital currencies and heightened concerns about a weakening economy.CEO Zac Prince said in a tweet Monday that BlockFi has been impacted by the \"dramatic shift in macroeconomic conditions,\" which have had a \"negative impact\" on growth.Backed by venture capitalist Peter Thiel, BlockFi has grown dramatically in recent years, benefiting from low borrowing costs and the surge in crypto prices. Prior to the latest cuts, the company expanded from 150 employees at the end of 2020, to more than 850.BlockFi, which offers a popular savings product that lets clients accrue interest on their digital currency holdings, reportedly raised more than $957 million since launching in 2017, and was reportedly aiming for a valuation of close to $5 billion last year. However, industry publication The Block reported last week that the company was in the process raising a down round at a valuation of around $1 billion.Crypto companies across the board are looking for ways to cut costs, as investors rotate out of the riskiest assets, pulling down trading volumes. Bitcoin is down by almost half this year after plunging 15% on Monday, while ethereum has lost two-thirds of its value in 2022, plummeting 16% to start the week. The crypto market has fallen below $1 trillion, down from $3 trillion at its peak in Nov. 2021.Crypto.com recently announced a staff reduction of 260 people, as did Gemini, which said it would be laying off 10% of its workforce — a first for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange and custodian. Meanwhile, Coinbase has extended its hiring pause for the \"foreseeable future\" and plans to rescind some job offers.Celsius, another crypto lender, has just paused all withdrawals and transfers between accounts, given the \"extreme market conditions.\" Celsius has more than $8 billion lent out to clients, making it one of the biggest players in the crypto lending space.BlockFi publicly distanced itself from Celsius in a tweet on Monday, announcing that it \"has no exposure to Celsius\" and had \"never worked with them as a partner.\"Prince said BlockFi's main goal is \"to achieve profitability\" and that the company is \"here for the long haul.\"In addition to the job cuts, the platform is also reducing marketing spending, eliminating non-critical vendors, reducing executive compensation, and slowing headcount growth, according to a blog post from co-founders Prince and Flori Marquez.Prince said customers would not be impacted by the cuts.\"Clients will not experience any material changes to the quality of service they have come to expect, their funds are safeguarded, and all platforms and products continue to operate normally,\" Prince tweeted. While that may provide some comfort to people who've entrusted the company with their money, BlockFi has been facing increased scrutiny from regulators.In February, the company agreed to pay a $50 million penalty fee to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as another $50 million in fines to 32 states to settle similar charges related to its popular interest-bearing crypto accounts.WATCH: Crypto market hasn't reached the bottom yetwatch nowVIDEO5:5505:55The crypto market hasn't reached the bottom yet, says Delta's Kavita GuptaHalftime Report] \n",

      "capsula.article_text [watch nowVIDEO4:4304:43Crypto is here to stay despite recent volatility, says Deepak ChopraCrypto WorldIt's been a brutal stretch for the crypto market, and a hard time for cryptocurrency investors to keep their emotions in check.The sector's market cap collapse was led by terraUSD, one of the most popular U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, which imploded virtually overnight. But bitcoin and ethereum, too, saw massive price declines from their recent bull market highs.A cultural icon known for being in touch with emotions — and for his recent foray into the NFT space — Deepak Chopra says investors can't ignore the recent crypto market meltdown, but they should be able to see beyond it.\"The crypto world is in crisis, having lost trillions of dollars. We're in a bear market,\" Chopra recently told CNBC at Gary Vaynerchuk's \"VeeCon\" in Minneapolis.\"Right now is the time to think long-term in these financial markets, including crypto. I think emergence happens when you have maximum diversity of people hanging in there creatively, complimenting each other's strengths and having some kind of a spiritual and emotional ecosystem where they can help each other and that's happening right now in the crypto community,\" Chopra said.Deepak Chopra, co-founder of the Chopra Center for Wellbeing and the founder of the Chopra Foundation.Adam Jeffery | CNBCIt is unclear whether the recent rout marks the next \"crypto winter\" — a multiyear bear market that occurs on a cyclical basis for the crypto asset class — though dropping trading volumes on crypto exchanges is one sign that we may be headed in that direction. The last so-called crypto winter ran from 2018 into the fall of 2020 as the value of cryptocurrencies plunged and layoffs were rife.There are more than 19,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and dozens of blockchain platforms, the underlying technology that cryptocurrencies are built upon. Not all will survive, and some crypto industry leaders expect a period of \"creative destruction\" wiping out many players.Mark Cuban, who has become a big investor in blockchain-based technologies, recently compared the crypto crash to \"the lull that the internet went through\" during the dotcom bubble. He tweeted that there are too many imitators out there. \"The chains that copy what everyone else has, will fail,\" Cuban tweeted. \"We don't need NFTs or DeFi on every chain.\"Earlier this year, Chopra's foundation partnered with crypto crowdfunding platform EarthFund to launch a collection of NFT tokens aimed at helping people achieve mental and emotional health. Token holders can earn rewards that allow them to \"crowdfund a treasury and decide as a community which mental well-being projects get the funding they need to make a difference,\" according to a March statement.The Chopra Foundation has also participated in Hollywood actress Emilia Clarke's SameYou NFT initiative launched in November 2021, which aims to provide better treatment of those recovering from the injuries of brain stroke and injury.\"We're using artificial intelligence to talk to people who are feeling mentally challenged and if they need counseling, we have a token with EarthFund so that we can democratize well-being all over the world,\" Chopra said. \"This is the future. We want to create global communities of attention, affection, appreciation and acceptance, where people are there to support each other and have each others backs.\"NFTs are a type of digital asset created to track ownership of a virtual item using blockchain technology. Earlier this week, U.S. prosecutors announced that they're pursuing an insider trading charge involving these digital assets for the first time.\"I hope people don't get sucked into the melodrama [of NFTs], because the markets always reflect the fickle human mind. One day it's up, one day it's down, one bit of news and we're in a bull market, the next day there's bad news and we're in a bear market,\" Chopra said.\"Ultimately, history has shown that economic development will happen because we are creative human beings, but we have to hang in there and support each other. It's not a time for competition right now, but cooperation,\" he added.] \n",

      "Возможность введения системы оплаты криптовалютами в условиях санкцией представляется большой иллюзией, говорит директор по развитию exmo.com Мария Станкевич. Она напомнила, что еще в 2014 году на многих предприятиях с государственным участием во время введения санкций расчеты с помощью криптовалюты очень активно обсуждались как альтернатива традиционным инвестиционным инструментам.\n",
      "По словам эксперта, уже тогда многим казалось, что в случае реальности угрозы заморозки депозитов, гораздо более выгодно будет перевести средства в криптовалюты и таким образом быстро и безопасно вывести из страны.\n",
      "С тем, что идея устранения санкционных препятствий с помощью криптовалют не нова, согласился старший юрист Tomashevskaya & Partners Михаил Жужжалов. Он отметил, что и в 2018 году рассматривалось разрешение использования расчетов криптовалютой международными компаниями, учрежденными на территориях специальных административных районов (САР). Однако тогда поправка не преодолела негативного отношения регуляторов к криптовалюте, пояснил эксперт.\n",
      "Давление\n",
      "Обращение криптовалюты по самой ее природе никем не регулируется, поскольку нет центрального держателя, который мог бы блокировать или исправлять записи в блокчейне, говорит Жужжалов. Поэтому регуляторное давление оказывается на институциональных участников крипторынка — криптобиржи, P2P-площадки, токенизирующие платформы, на эмитентов цифровых активов, объяснил юрист.\n",
      "Он отметил, что поскольку многие участники криптоиндустрии действуют в самых разных странах мира и могут мгновенно появляться и уходить с рынка, оказать давление на них непросто. В то же время, эксперт обратил внимание на то, что давление на легализовавшихся участников рынка оказать легко, поскольку все они имеют те или иные разрешения или статусы: как правило, это лицензии или статус участника какого-то сендбокса (платформа, на которой проекты развиваются).\n",
      "«Если такие участники рынка — субъекты недружественных юрисдикций, они обязаны соблюдать санкции. А если они находятся в нейтральных странах, то на них может быть оказано давление вторичными санкциями, как недавно было с турецкими банками», — считает Жужжалов.\n",
      "Точно не существует никаких вариантов спрятать большие объемы транзакций, уверена Мария Станкевич. Поэтому всех, кто по-прежнему работает с Россией, используя криптовалюты, просто будут отправлять под санкции. И желающих продолжить такую работу заметно поубавится, полагает эксперт.\n",
      "Сейчас уже наблюдаются трудности с пополнением кошельков на крипто-биржах, отметил юрист КСК ГРУПП Александр Шарапов. По его словам, власти США могут оказать давление на торговые площадки и банки, ввести полный запрет на пополнение биржевых кошельков с российских счетов и от российских граждан. По крайней мере, это может коснуться платформ, зарегистрированных на территории США, либо имеющих счета в американских банках.\n",
      "Пути обхода\n",
      "Отсутствует возможность давления на частных лиц, если купля - продажа криптовалюты осуществляется за наличные, говорит Шарапов. Однако, юрист указал, что в таком случае криптовалюта может не приниматься для оплаты некоторыми участниками рынка, так как ее происхождение у лица, производящего оплату, не удастся установить.\n",
      "Такие платежи будут попадать в серую зону, так как неизвестно, при каких обстоятельствах была приобретена криптовалюта, а также за какие услуги проводился платеж, уточнил эксперт. Кроме того, криптовалюта, полученная с кошелька, принадлежащего российскому гражданину, скорее всего не сможет быть конвертирована в фиатную валюту, добавил он.\n",
      "Следующим шагом России могло бы быть создание независимого участника крипторынка, однако такой участник скорее всего быстро будет включен в санкционные списки и давление вторичными санкциями сохранится, полагает Михаил Жужжалов.\n",
      "Однако он придерживается мнения, что едва ли в России разрешат официальное создание такого субъекта. Скорее всего, будет использован субъект из нейтральной, но расположенной к России страны, считает эксперт.\n",
      "Он также заметил, что многое будет зависеть от технологий, позволяющих скрывать транзакции (миксеры). Американские органы безопасности давно научились отслеживать источники поступлений криптовалюты на счета, получив этот опыт в основном при борьбе с наркотрафиком, пояснил юрист.\n",
      "Отследить транзакции в криптовалюте еще проще, чем банковские переводы, добавила Станкевич. Конечно, есть какие-то лазейки, но эти же лазейки есть и в банковских переводах, где их даже больше, говорит эксперт.\n",

Углеродный след от майнинга, согласно документу, составил 27,4 млн тонн с середины 2021 по 2022 год, что в три раза больше, чем у крупнейшей угольной электростанции США, или примерно равно годовым выбросам от 6 млн автомобилей.\n",
      "Представители некоммерческих организаций, обеспокоены быстрым ростом отрасли майнинга в США с тех пор, как он был запрещен в Китае.

      "capsula.article_text Эксперты рассказали, насколько высок риск падения цены биткоина ниже $18 тыс., что нужно для смены медвежьих настроений и какое отношение к этому имеет Федеральная резервная система США\n",
      "В прошедшую среду состоялось заседание Федеральной резервной системы США (ФРС) по ставке. Регулятор повысил ее на 75 базисных пунктов — с 2,25-2,5% до 3-3,25% годовых. Повышение на 75 б.п. происходит на третьем заседании подряд. Рост ставок связан с высокой инфляцией, которая достигла максимума за последние 40 лет.\n",
      "Сразу после заседания ФРС курс биткоина сначала резко вырос и приблизился к отметке в $22 тыс., после чего обвалился ниже $19 тыс. и достиг трехмесячного минимума на отметке в $18,1 тыс. По состоянию на 23 сентября 12:50 мск криптовалюта торгуется на уровне в $19 тыс.\n",
      "Биткоин подешевел в среду, поскольку участники рынка продавали рисковые активы в ответ на повышение ставки ФРС, объяснил финансовый аналитик BitRiver Владислав Антонов. Он добавил. что участники рынка отреагировали продажами рисковых активов. Поскольку криптовалютный рынок коррелирует с фондовыми индексами, биткоин тоже просел.\n",
      "www.adv.rbc.ru\n",
      "Следующее заседание ФРС США состоится 1–2 ноября. По данным CME, ожидается повышение ставки на 1,25 процентных пункта на двух оставшихся заседаниях ФРС в 2022 году, что предполагает еще одно повышение ставки на 75 базисных пунктов.\n",
      "«Рынки постепенно приходят в себя, при этом очень важно, как закроется американский рынок в пятницу. От пятничного закрытия будет зависеть как пройдут торги по биткоину в выходные. Продавцы контролируют рынок, поэтому покупателям нужно напрячься, чтобы изменить медвежьи настроения», — предупредил эксперт.\n",
      "По его словам, чтобы восстановление пары BTC/USDt ускорилось, нужно пройти уровень $21 тыс. При этом высоки риски уйти ниже $18 тыс. , они больше 70%, считает аналитик.\n",
      "С ним согласился сооснователь ENCRY Foundation Роман Некрасов. Он отметил, что очередное повышение ставки подкосило возможности быков на крипторынке, и до конца года перспектив для существенного роста, даже до $30 тыс., у биткоина осталось мало.\n",
      "«Я полагаю, что ФРС еще повысит ставку до конца года, а это ударит по фондовым рынкам, акциям технологических компаний и криптовалютам» — добавил специалист.\n",
      "Не способствуют возобновлению роста также геополитическая напряженность и энергетический кризис, подчеркнул Некрасов. Он предположил, что биткоин вернется к росту во второй половине 2023 года, когда крипторынок испытает позитивный импульс от приближающегося халвинга.\n",
      "«Если судить по предыдущим халвингам, умеренный рост начнется за полгода до события, то есть осенью 2023 года, а основной бычий цикл придется на период 12-18 месяцев после халвинга, то есть на вторую половину 2024 года и первую половину 2025 года», — заключил эксперт.\n",
